White Dwarf Signatures of the VanAcker Contraction

⸻

M.1 Context and Motivation

Scarlet 2.0 introduces a torsional damping constant
α₀ ≈ 0.083,
which is proposed to modify gravitational and thermodynamic behavior in ultra-dense stellar objects.

White dwarfs provide a natural testbed for this hypothesis because of their extreme densities and well-characterized observables. Recent spectroscopic surveys (e.g., SDSS-V) report systematic radial-velocity offsets in the range 5–15 km s⁻¹, typically attributed to wavelength-calibration systematics or line-formation effects rather than new physics.

Scarlet instead interprets these anomalies as potential signatures of a density-dependent contraction of the space fabric (hereafter, the VanAcker Contraction).

⸻

M.2 Velocity Shift Hypothesis

Scarlet predicts that the effective gravitational redshift is modified by the torsional suppression constant according to

v_{\rm Scarlet} = v_{\rm GR} (1 - \alpha_0)^{-1}.

For a representative ultra-massive white dwarf with
M \approx 1.2\,M_\odot,
the standard GR gravitational redshift is approximately
v_{\rm GR} \approx 126~{\rm km\,s^{-1}}.

Applying the Scarlet correction yields
v_{\rm Scarlet} \approx 137.5~{\rm km\,s^{-1}},
corresponding to an excess shift
\Delta v \approx 11.5~{\rm km\,s^{-1}}.

This offset lies within current observational uncertainties but is systematic and therefore testable with sufficiently large samples and improved calibration.

M.3 Cooling Delays (Q-Branch)

Standard Interpretation

The observed “Q-branch” overdensity in the white dwarf luminosity function is commonly attributed to chemical energy release, particularly Neon-22 sedimentation, which slows cooling by releasing latent heat.

Scarlet Interpretation

Scarlet proposes that the VanAcker Contraction stores gravitational energy in the space fabric as torsional strain. As the star cools and contracts, this stored energy is gradually released into the stellar interior.

The available energy scale is estimated as
E_{\rm torsion} \approx 7.8 \times 10^{42}~{\rm J},
sufficient to delay cooling by approximately
\Delta t \approx 8~{\rm Gyr}.

Clarification (Baryonic-Leak Counter-Argument)

This energy is not radiated impulsively. It is stored non-radiatively in the space fabric and couples to baryonic matter only as the stellar density approaches the VanAcker saturation threshold during crystallization. This prevents anomalous luminosity spikes and avoids conflict with observed cooling curves.

M.4 Falsifiability and Testing

M.4.4 VanAcker Invariant

A discriminant is required to separate genuine contraction from simple mass misestimation.

Under standard GR, spectroscopic surface gravity (log g) and gravitational redshift (z_g) are tightly coupled. Scarlet predicts that in ultra-dense stars, torsional contraction increases z_g beyond that implied by log g:

z_{g,\rm Scarlet} \approx z_{g,\rm GR} (1 + \alpha_0).

A systematic ≈ 8.3 % excess in z_g relative to log g therefore indicates engagement of the space fabric rather than excess mass.

⸻

M.5 Terminology and Thresholds

M.5.1 Bedrock Saturation Threshold

The VanAcker Contraction becomes significant only when the stellar density approaches

\rho_{\rm crit} \approx 10^{6}~{\rm g\,cm^{-3}}.

This explains both:
• the presence of the effect in high-mass white dwarfs, and
• its absence in low-density main-sequence stars.

⸻

M.5.2 Naming Conventions

The generic term “torsional contraction” is replaced by:

• VanAcker Contraction
• Bedrock Limit

to associate the effect directly with the Scarlet formalism.

⸻

M.5.3 Null Test (Solar-Type Stars)

Main-sequence stars do not approach \rho_{\rm crit}.

Therefore, α₀ corrections must be observationally negligible in such systems. This distinguishes Scarlet from tired-light or generic modified-redshift models.

M.6 Summary of Predictions
	1.	Velocity Verification
High-mass white dwarfs should exhibit
\Delta v \approx \alpha_0 v_{\rm GR} \approx 11.5~{\rm km\,s^{-1}}.
	2.	Cooling Delay
The Q-branch stagnation arises from gradual release of torsional strain energy.
	3.	Spectroscopic Signature
A decoupling of log g and z_g at the ≈ 8 % level.
	4.	Density Threshold
No detectable effect below
\rho_{\rm crit} \approx 10^{6}~{\rm g\,cm^{-3}}.
