Axiom for Appendix L

Axiom L.1 (Torsional Light Propagation):
Photons are transverse torsional excitations of the space fabric, and their cumulative energy loss over cosmological distances is governed solely by the universal torsional damping coefficient \gamma, which is independent of photon frequency.


Appendix L: Torsional Propagation Model for Light (Final Revised)


This appendix formulates photon propagation in Scarlet 2.0 as a weakly damped torsional excitation of the space fabric. The resulting formalism introduces a small, universal dissipative channel consistent with existing cosmological observations and linked to the same mechanism responsible for late-time structure suppression.

L.1 Postulates

Fabric Medium:
Spacetime is modeled as a torsion-capable elastic continuum characterized by a fundamental anchoring scale
\ell_b \sim 10^{-41},
which acts as an ultraviolet cutoff below which torsional modes cannot propagate. Damping effects vanish for wavelengths \lambda \ll \ell_b.
Elastic Limit:
The fabric exhibits an effective elastic reset speed identified with the observed speed of light,
c^2 = \frac{K_t}{\rho_t},
where K_t denotes the torsional stiffness and \rho_t the effective torsional inertia density.
Photon Interpretation:
Light corresponds to a transverse torsional perturbation of the fabric, described by a dimensionless displacement field \theta(x,t).

L.2 Torsional Wave Equation
Photon propagation obeys a damped wave equation,

\frac{\partial^2 \theta}{\partial t^2} - c^2 \nabla^2 \theta + \gamma\,\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial t} = 0,

where \gamma is a universal torsional damping coefficient with dimensions of inverse time.

This damping term encodes cumulative fabric fatigue and is independent of photon frequency to leading order (achromatic).

L.3 Redshift as Combined Expansion and Torsional Dissipation

For plane-wave solutions \theta \sim e^{i(kx-\omega t)}, the dispersion relation becomes

\omega^2 + i\gamma \omega - c^2 k^2 = 0.

In the weak-damping regime (\gamma \ll \omega),

\omega(t) \approx \omega_0 e^{-\gamma t/2}.

The observed fractional frequency shift is therefore

\frac{\Delta \nu}{\nu} = - \int \left[ H(t) + \frac{\gamma}{2} \right] dt.

In the limit \gamma \to 0, the standard ΛCDM redshift relation is recovered.
Because \gamma is achromatic, this mechanism preserves spectral shape to first order and does not distort blackbody radiation.

L.4 Dissipation Channel and Energy Conservation
Energy lost by photons through torsional damping is transferred into sub-threshold fabric modes below the propagation cutoff \ell_b. These modes do not re-radiate thermally and therefore do not contribute to the cosmic microwave background temperature.
Thus, total energy is conserved within the fabric–photon system, while observationally appearing as a slow secular redshift component.
L.5 Link to Late-Time Structure Suppression
Appendix K introduces a phenomenological growth-damping parameter \alpha describing the observed suppression of matter clustering. Consistency between photon evolution and structure growth requires a common torsional dissipation scale:
\gamma = \alpha\, H_0,
where H_0 is the present Hubble rate.
Using the empirically inferred value \alpha \simeq 0.083, Scarlet predicts
\gamma \approx 0.083\, H_0.
Thus, the same torsional dissipation parameter governs both photon energy loss and reduced structure growth.

L.6 Torsional Contributions to Lensing
In regions of strong mass concentration, torsional stress modifies photon trajectories according to

\frac{d^2 x}{ds^2} = - \nabla\!\left(\Phi + \lambda\,\theta\right),

where \Phi is the Newtonian gravitational potential and \lambda \ll 1 is a dimensionless coupling constant constrained by existing gravitational lensing bounds.

This predicts small departures from pure GR lensing in high-mass systems and a weak, scale-dependent residual in cluster lensing profiles.

L.7 Falsifiable Consequences
This formulation yields three observationally testable predictions:
Brightness–redshift relation:
A small excess dimming beyond ΛCDM scaling proportional to \gamma/H_0.
Lensing residuals:
Systematic departures from GR lensing at the few-percent level in massive clusters.
Structure–photon coupling:
A correlation between growth suppression (S_8 tension) and luminosity-distance residuals.
