Appendix W — Proton Fatigue, Stellar Evolution, and Cosmological Energy Flow (Scarlet 2.0)

⸻

W.1 Overview

In the Scarlet 2.0 framework, baryons are not treated as immutable point particles with fixed intrinsic mass. Instead, the proton is modeled as a localized torsional excitation of the underlying spacetime manifold. Its observed rest mass reflects both inertial mass and stored torsional strain energy.

Over cosmological timescales, this stored torsional energy relaxes through discrete nuclear interaction channels. This slow, monotonic relaxation process is termed proton fatigue.

Appendix W formalizes the hypothesis that the effective proton mass evolves downward from an initial high-tension state toward its present measured value. This evolution provides a unified physical mechanism for:

• enhanced stellar energetics in the early universe
• rapid early chemical enrichment
• late-time suppression of structure growth
• cosmological energy outflow without invoking vacuum energy

W.2 Proton Mass as a Torsional Energy Reservoir

Within Scarlet, proton mass is decomposed into two components:

m_p = m_{\text{rest}} + E_{\text{torsion}}/c^2

where E_{\text{torsion}} represents strain energy stored in spacetime’s torsional degrees of freedom.

At baryogenesis, protons formed in a higher-tension configuration, corresponding to a larger effective mass. As the universe evolves, torsional strain is released through quantized nuclear processes, causing a gradual decrease in E_{\text{torsion}} and therefore in effective proton mass.

This evolution is global and uniform at a given cosmic epoch, preserving local Lorentz invariance and local conservation laws. Laboratory physics remains unchanged; only the global normalization of baryonic mass evolves.

W.3 Early Stellar Regime

Stars forming from high-tension baryons operated in a modified nuclear regime. Elevated proton mass increased the energy released per fusion reaction, producing:
	1.	Higher luminosities at fixed stellar mass
	2.	Shortened stellar lifetimes
	3.	Increased fusion reaction rates
	4.	Rapid production of heavy elements

This provides a physical explanation for the observed presence of chemically mature galaxies at unexpectedly high redshift. Early stellar populations were not simply more massive; they were powered by baryons containing excess torsional energy.

⸻

W.4 Transition to the Fatigue Phase

As torsional relaxation progressed, the effective proton mass declined. This reduced:

• nuclear energy yield per reaction
• gravitational binding strength of baryonic matter
• efficiency of hierarchical structure formation

The transition defines a cosmic yield point at which torsional energy release dominates over its reabsorption into bound states.

This marks the onset of the late-time cosmological regime characterized by:
	1.	Reduced matter clustering
	2.	Lower stellar luminosities
	3.	Increased importance of non-gravitational energy transport
	4.	Emergent large-scale expansion behavior

⸻

W.5 Neutrino Energy Evolution

Proton–neutron conversion events act as discrete torsional release channels. Energy liberated in these transitions is primarily carried away by neutrino-like modes.

As proton fatigue advances, the torsional energy available per transition decreases. Consequently:

• early-epoch neutrinos are predicted to be systematically more energetic
• late-epoch neutrinos carry reduced characteristic energies

Neutrinos therefore encode the relaxation history of baryonic matter and serve as a time-dependent exhaust of torsional energy.

⸻

W.6 Coupling to Appendix V

Appendix V identifies neutron–proton transitions as the dominant release mechanism for stored torsional energy. Appendix W defines the evolving reservoir.

Together they form a closed energy cycle:

• Stored torsion (proton mass)
• Quantized release (n ↔ p transitions)
• Transport (neutrino emission)
• Macroscopic consequence (expansion and clustering suppression)

This links nuclear-scale physics directly to cosmological dynamics without invoking separate dark energy or dark matter components.

⸻

W.7 Cosmological Consequences

Gradual torsional energy loss from baryons produces two large-scale effects:
	1.	A reduction in effective gravitational clumping strength, accounting for late-time structure suppression
	2.	A net outward energy flux that manifests as cosmological expansion

These effects arise from internal energy redistribution rather than from a cosmological constant or vacuum energy term.

⸻

W.8 Falsifiability

The proton fatigue hypothesis is falsified if:

• proton mass is shown to be strictly invariant across cosmic epochs
• neutrino energy spectra are epoch-independent
• early stellar populations show no excess nuclear energetics
• late-time structure growth shows no suppression

Conversely, detection of epoch-dependent neutrino energies or baryon mass evolution would strongly support the model.

⸻

W.9 Conclusion

Appendix W establishes the proton as a slowly relaxing torsional energy reservoir whose evolution governs stellar behavior and cosmic dynamics. Combined with Appendix V’s treatment of neutron–proton transitions as quantized release events, Scarlet yields a unified mechanical explanation for:

• early luminous galaxies
• late-time expansion
• reduced matter clustering

The universe is thereby described not as a system driven by external dark components, but as a structure gradually relaxing its own stored torsional energy.
