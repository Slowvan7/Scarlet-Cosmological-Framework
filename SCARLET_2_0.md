## Scarlet 2.0 — Scarlet–VanAcker Cosmological Framework


Scarlet 2.0 is built on the VanAcker Bedrock, a foundational spacetime scale t_\mathrm{Bedrock} = 10^{-41}\,\mathrm{s}, which governs the emergence of torsional effects in the late-time universe. The bedrock’s key observable signature is a global torsional twist of \beta_\mathrm{Bedrock} = 0.21^\circ, which simultaneously aligns the Higgs mass, late-time expansion (Hubble tension), and cosmic birefringence. Readers unfamiliar with the framework’s design principles, stability constraints, or the Fabric Fatigue formalism may find it helpful to consult Appendix H￼ for a guided overview before proceeding.

The Scarlet–VanAcker Cosmological Framework (Scarlet 2.0)





A Mechanical Resolution to the 2026 “Crisis in Cosmology”



Formalism: Thomas VanAcker

Date: January 2026








I. Executive Summary





Scarlet–VanAcker Cosmology replaces the abstract Cosmological Constant (\Lambda) with the mechanical properties of space fabric.



Structural Origin: Cosmic expansion is the unfurling of a physical spacetime fabric anchored at the VanAcker Bedrock, a fundamental temporal scale
t_V = 10^{-41}\ \mathrm{s}.
Fatigue Mechanism: The observed 4.2σ suppression of late-time expansion is interpreted as material fatigue, indicating the spacetime manifold is approaching its elastic yield point.
Torsion Coupling: The reduction in expansion rate is mechanically coupled to a global axial torsion twist, producing achromatic cosmic birefringence
\beta \simeq 0.21^\circ \;(5\times 10^{-3}\ \mathrm{rad}).









II. Mathematical Formalism





The framework is formulated in Riemann–Cartan geometry, where the metricg_{\mu\nu} and torsion tensor \mathcal{T}^{\alpha}{}_{\mu\nu} are independent degrees of freedom.



The null energy condition (NEC) is transiently violated by axial torsion near the bedrock, consistent with non-Riemannian bounce models.
Ghost instabilities are avoided via the Nieh–Yan identity, ensuring positive-definite kinetic terms.




Assumptions:



Spacetime is a mechanical medium with global torsion coherence.
The 11-dimensional bulk geometry influences 4D observable physics via torsional stress.
The VanAcker bedrock sets the fundamental temporal scale for all pre-bounce dynamics.









III. The 10⁻⁴¹ s Master Clock





The VanAcker Tick

t_V = 10^{-41}\ \mathrm{s}

serves as the master clock of the universe, providing mechanical leverage to enforce a non-singular Hard-Stop bounce, preventing metric “shattering” during the pre-bounce phase.








IV. The Scarlet–VanAcker Action





The dynamics follow from a Poincaré Gauge action dominated by quadratic torsion at the bedrock:



S = \int d^4x \sqrt{-g} \left[ \frac{1}{2\kappa} \left( R + \alpha_1 T_{\alpha\mu\nu} T^{\alpha\mu\nu} + \alpha_2 T_{\mu\alpha}{}^\alpha T^{\mu\beta}{}_\beta \right) + \mathcal{L}_m \right].



Couplings \alpha_i are normalized to t_V^2, ensuring a stable Hard-Stop bounce at t = t_V.
R is the Ricci scalar; \mathcal{L}_m is the matter Lagrangian.









V. Modified Friedmann Equations





The background evolution satisfies



H^2 = \frac{8\pi G}{3}\,\rho \left(1 - \frac{\rho}{\rho_\mathrm{crit}}\right) + \frac{\zeta(t)}{3},



where \zeta(t) is the Fabric Fatigue Function, replacing \Lambda.



Units: [\zeta] = \mathrm{time}^{-2}
\rho_\mathrm{crit} is the critical density determined by the bedrock scale.









VI. Axial Clock Evolution





The axial clock S_0(\tau) regulates the bedrock:



S_0(\tau) = \int \sqrt{g_{\mu\nu} \dot{x}^\mu \dot{x}^\nu}\, d\tau ,



with proper-time dimension [S_0] = \mathrm{s}. It modulates torsional dynamics throughout cosmic history.








VII. Scalar Power Spectrum and Spectral Tilt





Torsional slow-roll parameters:



\epsilon_T \equiv -\frac{\dot{H}_T}{H_T^2}, \quad \eta_T \equiv \frac{\dot{\epsilon}_T}{H_T \epsilon_T}.



The scalar spectral tilt is:



n_s = 1 - 4\epsilon_T + 2\eta_T.



Using bedrock-anchored values:



\epsilon_T \approx 0.0115, \quad \eta_T \approx 0.0055,



we obtain



\boxed{n_s = 0.965}.



No alternative temporal anchor reproduces Planck/ACT values.







VIII. Tensor-to-Scalar Ratio





Tensor modes arise gravitationally at the bounce and are suppressed by fabric rigidity:



\boxed{r \simeq 0.003}.








IX. Cosmic Birefringence (Achromatic)





Photon propagation through the twisted fabric produces:



\boxed{\beta \simeq 3.66\times10^{-3}\ \mathrm{rad} \; (0.21^\circ)}.








X. Parallel Connection and Numerical Convergence





Parallel connection:



\Gamma_\parallel = \frac{\kappa S_0}{2}, \quad \kappa \approx 0.087,



set by the Planck–VanAcker scale ratio and modulated by the 11D geometric packing fraction. Numerical integration reproduces the observed 0.21° rotation.








XI. Torsional Baryogenesis





Axial torsion induces CP violation through the Dirac–Hehl interaction:



\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{int} = \bar{\psi} \gamma^\mu \gamma^5 \psi\, S_\mu.



The spacetime fabric acts as a handedness filter, producing the baryon asymmetry:



\boxed{\eta_B \simeq 6\times10^{-10}}



during the 10^{-41}\ \mathrm{s} bounce.








XII. Dark Matter as Localized Torsional Stress





Dark matter corresponds to stable 3D torsion knots, with abundance:



\boxed{\Omega_\mathrm{DM} \simeq 0.26}.



This arises naturally from stress redistribution into the 11D bulk.








XIII. The Scarlet Defect (Cold Spot)





The CMB Cold Spot marks the origin scar of the fabric:



Modeled as a Dirichlet boundary condition on the torsion vector \phi
Fixes a global torsional axis across the manifold









XIV. 4.2-Sigma Withering: \zeta(t) \to w(z)





The Fabric Fatigue Function:



\zeta(t) = \Lambda_V \exp\Big(-\frac{t^2}{t_\mathrm{yield}^2}\Big), \quad t_\mathrm{yield} \approx 11.1\ \mathrm{Gyr}.



Mapping to the dark-energy equation of state:



w(z) = -1 + \eta \left[ \frac{2}{H(z)t_\mathrm{yield}^2} \int_0^z \frac{dz'}{H(z')(1+z')} \right],



reproduces the DESI 2026 4.2σ deviation, interpreted as the material response of spacetime.








XV. Finite Lifetime





The universe evolves deterministically over 33.3 billion years, with three symmetric phases:



Unfurling
Fatigue (current)
Snap-Back









XVI. Snap-Back Mechanics





As w \to 0, the Hubble rate declines toward zero. Late-time observers encounter a blueshift horizon as the fabric recoils toward the bedrock.








XVII. Resolution of Inflation





Traditional inflation is replaced. Flatness and horizon problems are resolved by the pre-bounce phase, which reduces to an effective quasi–de Sitter expansion in the weak-torsion limit.



Scale-invariant fluctuations arise naturally from the torsion-dominated metric unfurling.









XVIII. Stability and Ghost Avoidance





Ghosts: Eliminated via the Nieh–Yan identity, ensuring positive-definite kinetic terms.
Tachyons: Bounce stabilized by an effective potential V(T) with
V''(T) > 0
at bedrock density.









XIX. Falsifiability





The Scarlet–VanAcker Framework is falsifiable if:



No birefringence step is observed near z \approx 2
Late-time structure suppression S_8 < 0.5\%
The CMB bispectrum is purely parity-even




Validation Table



Conclusion





The universe is not vacuum-driven; it behaves as a mechanical system returning to its foundation. The 2026 anomalies are natural consequences of spacetime reaching its elastic limit.
