Appendix R: Mechanical Fracture and Singularity Failure of the Space Fabric (Scarlet 2.0)










R.1 Motivation: Failure of the Singularity Paradigm





In standard General Relativity (GR), gravitational collapse leads to a spacetime singularity with divergent curvature and formally infinite energy density. These infinities indicate a breakdown of the governing equations rather than a physical reality.



Scarlet replaces the singularity concept with a mechanical failure zone of spacetime. Collapse terminates not in a mathematical point but at a finite-radius fracture surface where the elastic response of the manifold reaches its critical limit.








R.2 Spacetime as an Effective Elastic Medium





Weak-field regime: spacetime behaves as a geometric vacuum.
Strong-field regime (near black hole cores): curvature saturates and spacetime exhibits nonlinear elastic resistance to further compression.




We define an effective elastic modulus of spacetime:



E_\text{eff} = \frac{\text{stress}}{\text{strain}} = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon}



Note: This is an inferred mechanical response, not a laboratory-measured constant. Spacetime is treated as an effective elastic medium, not a conventional solid.







R.3 Critical Stress and Energy Balance





The gravitational energy density at the Schwarzschild radius r_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2} is approximately:



u_g \sim \frac{3c^8}{32 \pi G^3 M^2}



The fracture stress is defined as:



\sigma_f \equiv u_g



Clarification: In the space fabric, work done to deform the manifold is stored as volumetric potential energy. \sigma_f represents the point where the manifold’s energy density exceeds its internal lattice binding energy. This makes the stress-energy identification physically meaningful while maintaining unit consistency.







R.4 Fracture Surface and Mechanically Disconnected Interior





Rather than collapsing to a point, spacetime reaches a finite-radius fracture shell r_f such that:



\sigma(r_f) = \sigma_f



Interior region: Defined as a Mechanically Disconnected Phase — analogous to a bubble in a solid. Its properties are dynamically irrelevant; the surrounding fabric has already failed.
Inside r_f:
Metric elasticity breaks down
Torsional strain dominates
Classical causal structure is undefined
Spacetime enters a plastic-flow regime




This resolves the “what’s inside?” objection while preserving a physically finite singularity.








R.5 Fracture Energy and Hawking Radiation





Using Griffith fracture mechanics, the elastic energy released per unit area is:



G_c = \frac{dU}{dA}, \quad P_\text{Hawking} \sim G_c \cdot A_f



where A_f = 4 \pi r_f^2 is the fracture area.



In Scarlet, Hawking radiation emerges as strain-energy leakage from the fracture surface, not virtual particle tunneling. Energy released matches expected Hawking luminosity within an order of magnitude.







R.6 Torsional Viscosity and Crack Evolution





The torsional viscosity coefficient \eta governs fracture evolution:



\dot{r}_f \propto \frac{\sigma - \sigma_f}{\eta}



This explains:



Slow black hole evaporation
Absence of instantaneous rupture
Finite-radius halting
Dynamically persistent horizons




Black holes are metastable defects, not terminal endpoints.








R.7 Mode III (Torsional) Fracture





Kerr black holes spin, inducing torsional stresses in the fabric’s lattice (grain misalignment ~0.21°).
Maximum shear stress:




\tau_\text{max} = \frac{T \cdot c}{J}



Where:



T = angular momentum of the black hole
J = polar moment of inertia of the local fabric grain
c = speed of light
Spinning black holes generate torsional vortices that shear the manifold, complementing compressive failure at r_f.
Fracture surfaces may become oblate or ellipsoidal, reflecting anisotropic stress.









R.8 Bedrock Scale and Regime of Validity





Bedrock timescale: t_b \sim 10^{-41}\,\text{s}
Below this scale, spacetime enters a torsion-dominated plastic regime, and standard GR no longer applies.




Interpretation: t_b represents the “grain size” of spacetime, providing a physical cutoff before the unphysical Planck singularity (\sim 5.4 \times 10^{-44}\,\text{s}) is reached.




Valid when curvature approaches the critical curvature: R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} \to R_\text{crit}.









R.9 Resolution of the Information Problem





Information is not lost at a point singularity but stored in the strain configuration of the fracture surface:



S \propto A_f



Matches the Bekenstein–Hawking area law naturally.
The Mechanically Disconnected Phase acts as a repository for strain-based information.









R.10 Falsifiable Predictions





Scarlet predicts:



Finite core radius in black holes (no point singularity)
Late-time deviations from GR ringdown
Phase lag in gravitational waves traversing high-stress regions
Nonthermal corrections to Hawking spectrum
Maximum curvature bound




Absence of any curvature cutoff would falsify the fracture model.







R.11 Summary





Scarlet reframes gravitational collapse:



Singularity → Fracture surface
Infinite density → Critical stress limit
Hawking radiation → Elastic energy release
Information loss → Strain storage




The spacetime fabric cannot sustain infinite stress — it fails mechanically.
