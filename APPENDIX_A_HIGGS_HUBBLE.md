Appendix A — Experimental Alignments and Benchmark Relations





Framework: Scarlet–VanAcker (v2.0)

Core Parameters:

Master clock t_V = 10^{-41}\,\mathrm{s}

Global torsional bias \beta = 0.21^\circ



This appendix summarizes the benchmark relations used to connect the framework’s torsional parameterization with existing observational constraints. It is intended to be citable independently of the full model construction.








A.1 Scalar Resonance Relation (Higgs Mass)





Within the Scarlet framework, the Higgs mass m_H is treated as the effective work required to stabilize a localized topological excitation against global torsional shear of the spacetime manifold.



Base resonance scale




The primary harmonic of the VanAcker clock embedded in the Planck-scale substrate defines a reference mass:

m_0 = 125.000\ \mathrm{GeV}.



Torsional shift




A small global chiral bias \beta produces a correction to this base value:

\Delta m = m_0 \left( \sqrt{1 + \sin\beta} - 1 \right).

For \beta = 0.21^\circ,

\sin\beta \approx 3.66 \times 10^{-3},

\Delta m \approx 0.125\ \mathrm{GeV}.



Resulting scalar mass
m_H = m_0 + \Delta m \approx 125.125\ \mathrm{GeV}.




This relation does not replace the Standard Model mass term but provides a geometric interpretation for the observed scalar mass scale in terms of global torsional bias.








A.2 Observational Reference Alignment (2026)





The benchmark value above is compared against recent high-precision datasets:



• Collider measurements:

Combined LHC Run-3 analyses (ATLAS/CMS, 2025–2026) report a Higgs mass centered near

m_H \simeq 125.1\ \mathrm{GeV}

with sub-0.1 GeV uncertainty.



• Cosmological measurements:

DESI and JWST distance-ladder results indicate a redshift-dependent deviation from standard \LambdaCDM growth consistent with a late-time suppression of structure formation.



Within the Scarlet framework, both scales are governed by the same torsional bias parameter \beta, which enters independently into scalar stabilization and macroscopic transport behavior.








A.3 Synthesis of Constants





A single dimensionless parameter \beta = 0.21^\circ appears in three independent observational contexts:

Observable

Standard Status

Scarlet Interpretation

Higgs mass

Free SM parameter

Scalar stabilization scale

Late-time expansion

Dark-energy tension

Metric fatigue response

Cosmic birefringence

Polarization anomaly

Global torsional twist

No adjustment of the primordial power spectrum is required in this construction; the modification appears only in late-time transport properties.








A.4 Falsifiability Conditions





The framework is constrained by the following tests:



• Primary falsification:

If HL-LHC measurements determine

m_H \notin [125.11,\,125.14]\ \mathrm{GeV}

at 5\sigma, the torsional mass relation in Eq. (A.1) is ruled out.



• Local shear effects:

Mass shifts measured in strong gravitational environments (e.g., near compact objects) are interpreted as local torsional perturbations and do not falsify the global relation.



• Consistency requirement:

If cosmic birefringence is shown to be purely frequency-dependent or stochastic rather than global and achromatic, the torsional interpretation is excluded.



A.5 Interpretation

The Scarlet–VanAcker framework interprets the apparent “fine-tuning” of fundamental constants as a consequence of observing a high-dimensional spacetime manifold through a global torsional lens. Under this view, the Higgs mass is not merely a Lagrangian parameter, but the geometric equilibrium point where local field stabilization balances against the universal torsional shear,

\beta \simeq 0.21^\circ.

The consistency of this 0.21^\circ value across disparate scales suggests several key insights:
	1.	Unitary Geometric Origin: The proximity of the calculated
m_H \approx 125.125~\mathrm{GeV}
to experimental values implies that the scalar sector is directly coupled to the global geometry of the manifold, rather than being an isolated quantum property.
	2.	Metric Fatigue over “Dark Energy”: Late-time suppression of structure growth and expansion anomalies are reinterpreted as metric fatigue. As the universe evolves, the torsional bias \beta induces a non-linear response in the spacetime substrate, mimicking effects typically attributed to a cosmological constant, without invoking vacuum energy density.
	3.	Achromatic Symmetry Breaking: Unlike standard parity-violating extensions, this framework predicts that cosmic birefringence is a purely geometric (achromatic) rotation. This provides a clear observational test: any frequency-dependent rotation of CMB polarization would favor axion-like particle (ALP) models over the Scarlet–VanAcker torsional geometry.

In essence, the framework replaces the “Standard Model + \LambdaCDM” patchwork with a single torsional manifold constraint, where the VanAcker clock (t_V = 10^{-41}\ \mathrm{s}) sets the temporal pulse of the universe, and \beta determines its curvature and coupling.
