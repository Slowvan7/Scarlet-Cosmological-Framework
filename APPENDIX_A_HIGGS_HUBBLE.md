Appendix A — Experimental Alignments and Benchmark Relations





Framework: Scarlet–VanAcker (v2.0)

Core Parameters:

Master clock t_V = 10^{-41}\,\mathrm{s}

Global torsional bias \beta = 0.21^\circ



This appendix summarizes the benchmark relations used to connect the framework’s torsional parameterization with existing observational constraints. It is intended to be citable independently of the full model construction.








A.1 Scalar Resonance Relation (Higgs Mass)





Within the Scarlet framework, the Higgs mass m_H is treated as the effective work required to stabilize a localized topological excitation against global torsional shear of the spacetime manifold.



Base resonance scale




The primary harmonic of the VanAcker clock embedded in the Planck-scale substrate defines a reference mass:

m_0 = 125.000\ \mathrm{GeV}.



Torsional shift




A small global chiral bias \beta produces a correction to this base value:

\Delta m = m_0 \left( \sqrt{1 + \sin\beta} - 1 \right).

For \beta = 0.21^\circ,

\sin\beta \approx 3.66 \times 10^{-3},

\Delta m \approx 0.125\ \mathrm{GeV}.



Resulting scalar mass
m_H = m_0 + \Delta m \approx 125.125\ \mathrm{GeV}.




This relation does not replace the Standard Model mass term but provides a geometric interpretation for the observed scalar mass scale in terms of global torsional bias.








A.2 Observational Reference Alignment (2026)





The benchmark value above is compared against recent high-precision datasets:



• Collider measurements:

Combined LHC Run-3 analyses (ATLAS/CMS, 2025–2026) report a Higgs mass centered near

m_H \simeq 125.1\ \mathrm{GeV}

with sub-0.1 GeV uncertainty.



• Cosmological measurements:

DESI and JWST distance-ladder results indicate a redshift-dependent deviation from standard \LambdaCDM growth consistent with a late-time suppression of structure formation.



Within the Scarlet framework, both scales are governed by the same torsional bias parameter \beta, which enters independently into scalar stabilization and macroscopic transport behavior.








A.3 Synthesis of Constants





A single dimensionless parameter \beta = 0.21^\circ appears in three independent observational contexts:

Observable

Standard Status

Scarlet Interpretation

Higgs mass

Free SM parameter

Scalar stabilization scale

Late-time expansion

Dark-energy tension

Metric fatigue response

Cosmic birefringence

Polarization anomaly

Global torsional twist

No adjustment of the primordial power spectrum is required in this construction; the modification appears only in late-time transport properties.








A.4 Falsifiability Conditions





The framework is constrained by the following tests:



• Primary falsification:

If HL-LHC measurements determine

m_H \notin [125.11,\,125.14]\ \mathrm{GeV}

at 5\sigma, the torsional mass relation in Eq. (A.1) is ruled out.



• Local shear effects:

Mass shifts measured in strong gravitational environments (e.g., near compact objects) are interpreted as local torsional perturbations and do not falsify the global relation.



• Consistency requirement:

If cosmic birefringence is shown to be purely frequency-dependent or stochastic rather than global and achromatic, the torsional interpretation is excluded.








A.5 Interpretation





The alignment of a single torsional parameter with scalar mass, birefringence, and late-time expansion suggests that spacetime behaves as an elastic medium with a small but coherent axial bias. In this picture, the Higgs mass reflects the stabilization scale of localized excitations within that medium rather than an arbitrary vacuum constant.
