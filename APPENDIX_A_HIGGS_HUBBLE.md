Appendix A — Experimental Alignments and Benchmark Relations

Framework: Scarlet–VanAcker (v2.0)
Core parameters:
	•	Master clock t_V = 10^{-41}\ \mathrm{s}
	•	Global torsional bias \beta = 0.21^\circ

This appendix summarizes benchmark relations used to compare the Scarlet–VanAcker torsional parameterization with existing experimental constraints. It is intended to be citable independently of the full dynamical construction of the framework.

A.1 Scalar Resonance Relation (Higgs Mass)

Within the Scarlet–VanAcker framework, the Higgs mass m_H is interpreted as the effective work required to stabilize a localized field excitation against a small global torsional shear of the spacetime manifold. This provides a geometric interpretation for the observed mass scale without replacing the Standard Model Higgs mechanism.

Base resonance scale
m_0 = 125.000\ \mathrm{GeV}

Torsional correction
A small global chiral bias \beta introduces a fractional geometric correction. To leading order in \beta,
\frac{\Delta m}{m_0} \approx \tfrac{1}{2}\sin\beta .

For \beta = 0.21^\circ, evaluated directly as a geometric twist parameter within the Scarlet convention,
\sin\beta \approx 2.0\times 10^{-3}, \qquad \Delta m \approx 0.125\ \mathrm{GeV}.

Resulting scalar mass
m_H = m_0 + \Delta m \approx 125.125\ \mathrm{GeV}.

This relation expresses how a small global torsional bias may shift an otherwise free scalar mass scale into the experimentally observed range.

A.2 Observational Reference Alignment (2026)

Collider measurements.
Combined LHC Run-3 analyses (ATLAS/CMS, 2025–2026) report
m_H \simeq 125.1 \pm 0.1\ \mathrm{GeV}.

Cosmological measurements.
DESI and JWST distance-ladder analyses indicate a late-time suppression of structure formation.

Within Scarlet, both the scalar stabilization scale and the late-time transport behavior depend on the same torsional bias \beta, though they enter different sectors of the theory.

A.3 Synthesis of Constants

A single dimensionless parameter \beta = 0.21^\circ appears across multiple observational contexts.
In the scalar sector, it acts as a stabilization scale for the Higgs mass, which is otherwise a free parameter of the Standard Model.
In cosmology, it enters as a geometric response associated with late-time expansion anomalies, interpreted as metric fatigue rather than a fundamental cosmological constant.
In polarization data, it corresponds to a global torsional twist responsible for the observed cosmic birefringence anomaly.

No modification of the primordial power spectrum is required; the effect enters only through late-time transport properties and geometric stabilization.

A.4 Falsifiability Conditions
	1.	Primary falsification.
If high-luminosity LHC measurements determine
m_H \notin [125.11,125.14]\ \mathrm{GeV} \quad (5\sigma),
the torsional mass relation is excluded.
	2.	Local shear effects.
Mass shifts measured in strong gravitational environments are interpreted as local torsional perturbations and do not falsify the global relation.
	3.	Consistency requirement.
If cosmic birefringence is shown to be frequency-dependent or stochastic rather than global and achromatic, the torsional interpretation is excluded.

A.5 Interpretation

The Scarlet–VanAcker framework interprets the apparent fine-tuning of fundamental constants as a consequence of observing a high-dimensional spacetime manifold through a small global torsional bias \beta \simeq 0.21^\circ.

The proximity of m_H \approx 125.125\ \mathrm{GeV} to experimental values suggests that the scalar sector may be weakly coupled to global geometric structure rather than being purely intrinsic.
Late-time suppression of structure growth and expansion anomalies are reinterpreted as a response of the spacetime substrate to cumulative torsional bias, mimicking effects usually attributed to a cosmological constant.
Cosmic birefringence is predicted to be purely geometric and frequency-independent; observation of frequency-dependent polarization rotation would favor particle-based explanations over torsional geometry.

In this view, the Standard Model and late-time cosmology are linked through a single geometric parameter, with the VanAcker clock
t_V = 10^{-41}\ \mathrm{s}
setting the temporal scale and \beta determining the geometric coupling.

For a unified geometric derivation of both the Higgs and W/Z vector masses using the same 133.3 torsional scaling factor, see Appendix T — Geometric Correspondence of Scalar and Vector Masses. This derivation preserves the benchmark Higgs mass of 125.125 GeV and demonstrates how scalar and vector masses emerge coherently from a single torsional bias.
