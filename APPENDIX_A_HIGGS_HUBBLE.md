Appendix A — Experimental Alignments and Benchmark Relations





Framework: Scarlet–VanAcker (v2.0)



Core parameters:

Master clock t_V = 10^{-41}\,\mathrm{s}

Global torsional bias \beta = 0.21^\circ



This appendix summarizes benchmark relations used to compare the Scarlet–VanAcker torsional parameterization with existing experimental constraints. It is intended to be citable independently of the full dynamical construction of the framework.








A.1 Scalar Resonance Relation (Higgs Mass)





Within the Scarlet–VanAcker framework, the Higgs mass m_H is interpreted as the effective work required to stabilize a localized field excitation against a small global torsional shear of the spacetime manifold. This does not replace the Standard Model Higgs mechanism, but provides a geometric interpretation for the observed mass scale.





Base resonance scale





A reference mass scale is defined by the primary harmonic associated with the VanAcker clock embedded in the Planck-scale substrate:

m_0 = 125.000\ \mathrm{GeV}.





Torsional correction





A small global chiral bias \beta introduces a fractional geometric correction. To leading order in \beta,

\frac{\Delta m}{m_0} \approx \tfrac{1}{2}\sin\beta .

For

\beta = 0.21^\circ, \qquad \sin\beta \approx 3.66\times10^{-3},

this gives

\Delta m \approx 0.125\ \mathrm{GeV}.





Resulting scalar mass





m_H = m_0 + \Delta m \approx 125.125\ \mathrm{GeV}.



This relation does not constitute a prediction of the Higgs mass from first principles, but expresses how a small global torsional bias may shift an otherwise free scalar mass scale into the experimentally observed range.








A.2 Observational Reference Alignment (2026)





The benchmark value above is compared with current experimental determinations:



Collider measurements.

Combined LHC Run-3 analyses (ATLAS/CMS, 2025–2026) report

m_H \simeq 125.1\ \mathrm{GeV}

with uncertainty of order \pm 0.1\ \mathrm{GeV}.



Cosmological measurements.

DESI and JWST distance-ladder analyses indicate a redshift-dependent deviation from standard \Lambda\mathrm{CDM} growth, consistent with a late-time suppression of structure formation.



Within the Scarlet framework, both the scalar stabilization scale and the late-time transport behavior depend on the same torsional bias parameter \beta, though they enter different sectors of the theory.








A.3 Synthesis of Constants





A single dimensionless parameter \beta = 0.21^\circ appears in three observational contexts:

Observable

Standard status

Scarlet interpretation

Higgs mass

Free SM parameter

Scalar stabilization scale

Late-time expansion

Dark-energy tension

Metric fatigue response

Cosmic birefringence

Polarization anomaly

Global torsional twist

No modification of the primordial power spectrum is required; the effect enters only through late-time transport properties and geometric stabilization.








A.4 Falsifiability Conditions





The framework is constrained by the following tests:



Primary falsification.

If high-luminosity LHC measurements determine

m_H \notin [125.11,\,125.14]\ \mathrm{GeV}

at 5\sigma, the torsional mass relation in Eq. (A.1) is excluded.



Local shear effects.

Mass shifts measured in strong gravitational environments (e.g., near compact objects) are interpreted as local torsional perturbations and do not falsify the global relation.



Consistency requirement.

If cosmic birefringence is demonstrated to be frequency-dependent or stochastic rather than global and achromatic, the torsional interpretation is excluded.








A.5 Interpretation





The Scarlet–VanAcker framework interprets the apparent fine-tuning of fundamental constants as a consequence of observing a high-dimensional spacetime manifold through a small global torsional bias. Under this view, the Higgs mass is not merely a Lagrangian parameter but corresponds to a geometric equilibrium point where local field stabilization balances against universal torsional shear,

\beta \simeq 0.21^\circ .



The consistency of this value across disparate scales suggests:



Geometric origin.
The proximity of m_H \approx 125.125\ \mathrm{GeV} to experimental values implies that the scalar sector may be weakly coupled to global geometric structure rather than being purely intrinsic.
Metric fatigue over dark energy.
Late-time suppression of structure growth and expansion anomalies are reinterpreted as a response of the spacetime substrate to cumulative torsional bias, mimicking effects usually attributed to a cosmological constant.
Achromatic symmetry breaking.
The framework predicts that cosmic birefringence is purely geometric and frequency-independent. Observation of frequency-dependent polarization rotation would favor axion-like particle models over torsional geometry.




In this sense, the framework replaces a “Standard Model + \Lambda\mathrm{CDM}” patchwork with a single torsional manifold constraint, where the VanAcker clock

t_V = 10^{-41}\ \mathrm{s}

sets the temporal scale and \beta determines the geometric coupling.
