Appendix A — Experimental Alignments and Benchmark Relations (Corrected)

Framework: Scarlet–VanAcker (v2.0)
Core parameters:
	•	Master clock t_V = 10^{-41}\ \mathrm{s}
	•	Global torsional bias \beta = 0.21^\circ

This appendix summarizes benchmark relations used to compare the Scarlet–VanAcker torsional parameterization with existing experimental constraints. It is intended to be citable independently of the full dynamical construction of the framework.

A.1 Scalar Resonance Relation (Higgs Mass)
Within the Scarlet–VanAcker framework, the Higgs mass m_H is interpreted as the effective work required to stabilize a localized field excitation against a small global torsional shear of the spacetime manifold. This provides a geometric interpretation for the observed mass scale without replacing the Standard Model Higgs mechanism.

Base resonance scale
m_0 = 125.000\ \mathrm{GeV}

Torsional correction
A small global chiral bias \beta introduces a fractional geometric correction. To leading order in \beta:
\frac{\Delta m}{m_0} \approx \tfrac{1}{2}\sin\beta

For \beta = 0.21^\circ \approx 0.003665\ \mathrm{rad}:
\frac{\Delta m}{m_0} \approx 0.0018326 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \Delta m \approx 0.229\ \mathrm{GeV}

Resulting scalar mass
m_H = m_0 + \Delta m \approx 125.229\ \mathrm{GeV}

This relation expresses how a small global torsional bias may shift an otherwise free scalar mass scale into the experimentally observed range.

A.2 Observational Reference Alignment (2026)
	•	Collider measurements:
Combined LHC Run-3 analyses (ATLAS/CMS, 2025–2026) report
m_H \simeq 125.1 \pm 0.1\ \mathrm{GeV}
	•	Cosmological measurements:
DESI and JWST distance-ladder analyses indicate a late-time suppression of structure formation.

Within Scarlet, both the scalar stabilization scale and the late-time transport behavior depend on the same torsional bias \beta, though they enter different sectors of the theory.

A.3 Synthesis of Constants
A single dimensionless parameter \beta = 0.21^\circ appears across multiple observational contexts:
Observable
Standard status
Scarlet interpretation
Higgs mass
Free SM parameter
Scalar stabilization scale
Late-time expansion
Dark-energy tension
Metric fatigue response
Cosmic birefringence
Polarization anomaly
Global torsional twist
A.4 Falsifiability Conditions
	1.	Primary falsification:
If high-luminosity LHC measurements determine
m_H \notin [125.15, 125.30]\ \mathrm{GeV} \quad (5\sigma)
the torsional mass relation is excluded.
	2.	Local shear effects:
Mass shifts near compact objects are interpreted as local torsional perturbations and do not falsify the global relation.
	3.	Consistency requirement:
If cosmic birefringence is frequency-dependent or stochastic, the torsional interpretation is excluded.

A.5 Interpretation
The Scarlet–VanAcker framework interprets the apparent fine-tuning of fundamental constants as a consequence of observing a high-dimensional spacetime manifold through a small global torsional bias \beta \simeq 0.21^\circ.
	•	Geometric origin: The proximity of m_H \approx 125.229\ \mathrm{GeV} to experimental values implies that the scalar sector may be weakly coupled to global geometric structure.
	•	Metric fatigue over dark energy: Late-time suppression of structure growth is interpreted as a response of the spacetime substrate to cumulative torsional bias.
	•	Achromatic symmetry breaking: Cosmic birefringence is predicted to be purely geometric and frequency-independent.
