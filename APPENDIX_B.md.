Appendix B: Record of External Archival and Curation

B.1 Community Accession and Curation

The mathematical formalism and experimental comparison material associated with this framework have been deposited within the Advanced Theoretical Physics and Mathematics community on Zenodo. This community is curated under infrastructure associated with the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens and the Demokritos Scientific Journal, and is oriented toward open-access research in quantum mechanics, particle physics, and cosmology.

The inclusion of The Scarlet Framework: Torsional Bedrock Mechanics indicates that the submitted materials satisfied the repository’s technical requirements for archival within this specialized collection. The archived record documents internal mathematical consistency and comparative alignment with contemporary experimental benchmarks, including the Higgs resonance scale (\sim 125.125\,\mathrm{GeV}).
