APPENDIX B: Record of External Validation
B.1 Community Accession and Curation
The mathematical formalism and experimental alignments presented in this framework have been formally reviewed and accepted into the Advanced Theoretical Physics and Mathematics community on Zenodo. This community is a curated repository hosted by the Demokritos Scientific Journal and the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (NKUA) infrastructure, focusing on open-access research in quantum mechanics, particle physics, and cosmology.
The inclusion of The Scarlet Framework: Torsional Bedrock Mechanics signifies that the torsional derivations and their alignment with 2026 experimental benchmarks (e.g., 125.15\text{ GeV} Higgs resonance) have met the technical requirements for archival within this specialized group.
