Appendix P







Observable Consequences and Simulation Compatibility of Torsional Transport Loss





Purpose.

This appendix translates the Scarlet Updated Lagrangian (UL) formulation into (i) observable cosmological signatures and (ii) numerical schemes that can directly implement transport loss without violating microscopic unitarity.



Scarlet does not modify the Einstein field equations or gauge symmetries. It introduces an effective macroscopic transport-loss mechanism arising from accumulated torsional fatigue in the spacetime substrate.








P.1 Modified Growth Law





From the Updated Lagrangian with Rayleigh dissipation, the effective linear growth equation becomes:



\ddot{\delta} + (2H + \eta)\dot{\delta} - 4\pi G \rho \delta = 0



where

\delta is the matter overdensity,

H is the Hubble parameter,

\rho is the background matter density,

\eta(t) is the torsional transport-loss coefficient.



Properties:



For t < t_y: \eta = 0 → standard ΛCDM growth.
For t \ge t_y: \eta \neq 0 → suppressed clustering efficiency.




The integrated effect yields:

S_8^{\text{late}} = (1 - \alpha) S_8^{\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}}, \quad \alpha \approx 0.056



This suppression emerges dynamically and is not imposed as a boundary condition.








P.2 Redshift Signature





Scarlet predicts:



No deviation at recombination.
No deviation for z > 2.
Suppression activates at late times only.




Observable condition:

\Delta f\sigma_8(z) < 0 \quad \text{only for } z \lesssim 1



This distinguishes Scarlet from:



early dark energy,
modified gravity,
massive neutrinos,




all of which affect earlier epochs.








P.3 Compatible Simulation Classes





Scarlet requires no modification of force laws or metric solvers. Only transport equations acquire a dissipative term.





(i) N-body Simulations (Particle-Based)





Velocity update:

\vec{v}_{n+1} = \vec{v}_n + \Delta t \left( \vec{a}_n - \eta \vec{v}_n \right)



Poisson equation unchanged.
No new forces introduced.
Momentum conserved locally.




Scarlet appears as a late-time phase-space damping term.








(ii) Fluid / Hydrodynamic Codes





Density evolution:

\frac{\partial \delta}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \vec{u} = -\eta \delta



Implementable as:



source term in Eulerian solvers,
dissipation term in relativistic hydrodynamics,
late-time correction only.









(iii) Linear Boltzmann Codes





Perturbation evolution:

\dot{\theta}_k + H\theta_k = -k^2\phi_k - \eta \theta_k



No change to:



photon–baryon coupling,
metric perturbations,
recombination physics.




Activation occurs only for t \ge t_y.








(iv) Discrete-Time / Lattice Integrators





Given the micro-tick:

\Delta t = 10^{-41}\,\mathrm{s}



Scarlet naturally supports:



cellular spacetime schemes,
symplectic integrators,
causal lattice updates,




where the Updated Lagrangian resets the reference configuration at each tick:

L(t+\Delta t) \neq L(t)

due to accumulated fatigue.

P.5 Falsifiability





Scarlet is ruled out if:

S_8(z) < S_8^{\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}} \quad \text{for } z > 2



Scarlet survives if:



suppression appears only at late times,
the CMB remains unchanged,
growth shows a yield transition.









P.6 Yield Epoch and Growth Bifurcation





We define the Yield Epoch as:

t_y \equiv 11.1\,\mathrm{Gyr} \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad z_y \approx 0.3



For t < t_y:

\eta(t) = 0



For t \ge t_y:

\eta(t) \neq 0



This epoch coincides with the observed late-time bifurcation between early-universe and late-universe growth amplitudes.



Thus, the Scarlet Yield Epoch provides a physical interpretation of the growth bifurcation:

it represents the onset of macroscopic transport fatigue rather than a modification of gravity or initial conditions.








P.7 Energy Accounting and Torsional Fatigue





The Rayleigh dissipation functional:

\Phi(\dot{\zeta}) = \tfrac{1}{2} \eta \dot{\zeta}^2

represents work done against torsional resistance.



This energy is not destroyed but converted into internal degrees of freedom of the spacetime substrate:



E_{\text{transport}} \rightarrow E_{\text{fatigue}}



interpreted as:



accumulated torsional strain,
microscopic substrate excitation,
effective “bedrock heating.”




Therefore:



Local conservation laws hold.
Microscopic gauge dynamics remain unitary.
No violation of the First Law of Thermodynamics occurs.




The observed 0.21 slip fraction corresponds to finite transport efficiency, not missing energy.








P.8 Summary





Scarlet introduces:



an Updated Lagrangian formulation,
a Rayleigh dissipation functional,
a late-time transport-loss mechanism,




without violating:



general relativity,
gauge symmetry,
microscopic unitarity.




It is compatible with:



N-body solvers,
hydrodynamic codes,
Boltzmann hierarchies,
discrete spacetime models,




using a single time-dependent parameter \eta(t) such that:

\eta(t < t_y) = 0, \quad \eta(t \ge t_y) \neq 0
