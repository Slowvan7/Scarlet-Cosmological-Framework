### Appendix C: Geometric Correspondence of Vector Boson Resonances

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Phenomenological Framework:** This appendix identifies a **Geometric Correspondence** between the 0.21° Torsional Constant and the observed Electroweak mass ratio ($M_W/M_Z$). It treats the $Z$ mass as the empirical anchor for the space fabric's primary resonance.

#### 1. The Scaling Hypothesis
The relationship between the $W$ and $Z$ bosons is defined by a scaling factor **$\beta \approx 133.3$**, which maps the fundamental 0.21° torsional seed to the Electroweak scale ($\theta_W$).

| Particle | Geometric Relation | Ratio Value | Calculated Mass |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **$Z^0$** | Primary Resonance (Anchor) | 1.000 | **91.187 GeV** |
| **$W^{\pm}$** | $M_Z \cdot \cos(\beta \cdot 0.21^\circ)$ | ≈ 0.881 | **80.360 GeV** |



#### 2. Technical Correspondence
By identifying the **Weak Mixing Angle** as a product of the **Space Fabric** twist, the $W$ mass resonance is derived as a torsional displacement of the anchor:

$$\cos\theta_W \equiv \cos(133.3 \cdot 0.21^\circ) \approx 0.8817$$

**Resulting W-Mass:** **80.360 GeV**
*Matches the 2026 CMS measurement ($80360.2 \pm 9.9$ MeV) within 1$\sigma$ experimental tolerance.*

C.7 Interpretation and Limits





The weak mixing angle emerges as a stable torsional equilibrium.
The scaling factor \beta is derived from elastic response, not imposed.
No Standard Model parameters are replaced.
Absolute mass scales are not predicted.




This appendix establishes a mechanical origin for the electroweak mass ratio, consistent with the Scarlet framework’s elastic spacetime hypothesis.
