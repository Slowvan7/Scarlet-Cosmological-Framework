Appendix N: Time- and Geometry-Dependent Atomic Transitions in the Scarlet–VanAcker Framework










N.1 Physical Motivation





In the Scarlet–VanAcker framework, atomic transitions are not idealized as instantaneous or purely local quantum events. Instead, they involve a finite-time geometric reconfiguration of the surrounding space fabric.



In dense stellar environments, the cumulative effect of these microscopic interactions manifests as macroscopic spectral anomalies, including the excess redshift observed in ultra-massive white dwarfs.



This appendix formalizes the atomic-scale mechanism underlying these effects.








N.2 Time-Domain Component (Torsional Lag)





In standard quantum mechanics, electronic transitions are treated as effectively instantaneous relative to observational timescales.



Scarlet introduces a torsional damping constant \alpha_0, representing resistance of the space fabric to rapid geometric reconfiguration.



When an electron transitions between bound states, the surrounding vacuum configuration must relax from a higher-tension to a lower-tension torsional equilibrium state.



Let \Delta t_{\rm QM} be the standard transition time predicted by the Schrödinger equation.

Scarlet predicts:

\Delta t_{\rm Scarlet} = \Delta t_{\rm QM}(1+\alpha_0).



This defines a finite torsional relaxation time associated with atomic emission.





Prediction





High-precision attosecond pump–probe spectroscopy under extreme compression should reveal:

\Delta t_{\rm obs} > \Delta t_{\rm QM}.

This excess defines the Scarlet lag.








N.3 Geometric Knot Hierarchy





Atomic orbitals are reinterpreted as discrete torsional equilibrium states of the space fabric surrounding the nucleus.



Define a torsional density parameter \Omega_n for orbital level n.



Higher orbitals:
\Omega_n \ll \Omega_{n-1}
(looser vacuum configuration)
Lower orbitals:
\Omega_n \gg \Omega_{n+1}
(tighter vacuum configuration)




Electronic transitions correspond to discrete geometric reconfigurations:

\Delta \Omega = \Omega_{n_i} - \Omega_{n_f}.



Thus, photon emission is identified with the relaxation of a vacuum-geometry knot rather than a purely abstract state change.








N.4 Spectral Chirp (Line-Shape Distortion)





Because torsional relaxation occurs over a finite interval \Delta t_{\rm Scarlet}, the photon is emitted while the local space-fabric density \rho(t) evolves.



The emitted frequency becomes time-dependent:

\nu(t) = \nu_0\left[1 - \alpha_0 f(\rho(t))\right].



This produces a slight frequency modulation during emission.





Prediction (Lorentzian–Scarlet Profile)





Rather than a symmetric Lorentzian line shape, emission lines acquire an asymmetric profile:

\Gamma_{\rm red} > \Gamma_{\rm blue}.



The red wing is slightly inflated due to gradual torsional energy release during unwinding.



This effect modifies line shape, not merely line position.








N.5 Atomic–Stellar Scaling Law





Each atomic transition experiences a torsional delay proportional to \alpha_0.



In a stellar atmosphere containing N emitting atoms, the macroscopic effect is the cumulative result of microscopic delays.



Let each transition contribute a fractional shift:

\delta \nu \sim \alpha_0 \nu.



Then the stellar-scale excess redshift obeys:

\Delta v_{\rm stellar} \approx \alpha_0 v_{\rm GR}.



This establishes a direct physical link between atomic-scale torsional resistance and stellar-scale spectral shifts.



The observed:

\Delta v \sim 11.5~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}

in ultra-massive white dwarfs is thus interpreted as the integrated consequence of torsional resistance encountered by every emitting atom embedded in compressed space fabric.








N.6 Density Threshold (Bedrock Saturation)





Torsional effects become significant only when the ambient density approaches the Bedrock saturation threshold:

\rho_{\rm crit} \approx 10^{6}~\mathrm{g\,cm^{-3}}.



Below this threshold:

\alpha_0 \rightarrow 0.



Thus:



Effects appear in white dwarfs,
Vanish in main-sequence stars,
Are suppressed in laboratory vacuum conditions.









N.7 Falsifiability





The theory is falsified if:



Atomic transition times remain instantaneous under compression.
No asymmetric line broadening is observed.
Stellar redshift anomalies fail to scale with \alpha_0.
Effects appear in low-density systems.









N.8 Conceptual Unification





\text{Atomic torsional lag} \;\longrightarrow\; \text{spectral chirp} \;\longrightarrow\; \text{stellar redshift}.



Thus, the VanAcker Contraction provides a single geometric mechanism linking atomic emission physics to stellar gravitational redshift anomalies.
