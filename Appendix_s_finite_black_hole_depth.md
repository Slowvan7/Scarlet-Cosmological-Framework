Mechanical Termination of Gravitational Collapse (Scarlet 2.0)








S.1 Axiom: Finite Mechanical Extensibility





In Scarlet, spacetime is treated as a nonlinear elastic medium possessing a finite yield strength:



\sigma(r) = \sigma_y \approx 10^{113}\,\text{Pa}



When internal spacetime stress reaches this limit, further geometric compression is mechanically forbidden.

Gravitational collapse therefore halts at a finite radius rather than forming a point singularity.








S.2 Constitutive Relation





The spacetime stress–strain relation is



\sigma_{\mu\nu} = Y_{\mathrm{SF}}\,\varepsilon_{\mu\nu}



where:



\sigma_{\mu\nu} is the spacetime stress tensor
\varepsilon_{\mu\nu} is the manifold strain
Y_{\mathrm{SF}} is the space-fabric modulus




Failure occurs when |\varepsilon_{\mu\nu}| reaches the threshold corresponding to \sigma_y.








S.3 Fracture Radius





Define the fracture radius r_f by the yield condition:



\sigma(r_f) = \sigma_y



Collapse terminates at this radius, producing a finite termination surface (“fracture floor”) rather than a singularity.








S.4 Regime I: Elastic (Load-Dependent) Depth





In the elastic regime, the space fabric behaves as a stretchable medium.

The fracture depth scales with applied gravitational load:



r_f^{(I)} = R_s(1 - \alpha)



d_f^{(I)} = R_s - r_f^{(I)} = \alpha R_s



with



R_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2}



Thus,



d_f^{(I)} = \alpha \frac{2GM}{c^2}



Fracture depth increases linearly with black hole mass.








S.5 Regime II: Material-Limited (Intrinsic) Depth





In the material-limited regime, the space fabric possesses an intrinsic failure thickness determined by its microstructure:



d_f^{(II)} = d_0



independent of mass.

The fracture radius is therefore



r_f^{(II)} = R_s - d_0



Increasing mass enlarges the lateral extent of the fracture surface rather than increasing its depth.








S.6 Interior Structure





For both regimes, spacetime inside r_f enters a plastic-flow phase rather than divergent curvature.



Matter accumulates on a finite termination surface (“fracture floor”).



Properties:



finite interior volume
no divergent curvature
no infinite density
no point singularity




The black hole interior behaves as a mechanically bounded cavity rather than an infinite pit.








S.7 Torsional Echo Modes





The fracture floor acts as a partially reflective mechanical boundary.

Post-merger perturbations excite an elastic relaxation mode with characteristic frequency



f_{\mathrm{echo}} \sim \frac{c}{d_f}



Two regimes follow:



Elastic regime:



f_{\mathrm{echo}}^{(I)} \sim \frac{c}{\alpha R_s} \propto \frac{1}{M}



Material-limited regime:



f_{\mathrm{echo}}^{(II)} \sim \frac{c}{d_0} = \text{constant}



Thus:



Regime I predicts mass-dependent echo frequencies
Regime II predicts a universal echo frequency









S.8 Phase Lag Signature





The torsional echo exhibits a phase offset due to fabric damping:



\phi = \alpha \pi



relative to the fundamental ringdown mode.



Vacuum Kerr harmonics are strictly in phase.

Observation of a systematic phase lag would therefore signal a material response rather than pure geometric ringing.

S.10 Relation to Appendix L





Appendix L defines the torsional damping constant:



\gamma = \alpha H_0



Appendix S defines fracture depth:



d_f^{(I)} = \alpha R_s \quad\text{or}\quad d_f^{(II)} = d_0



Thus the same torsional parameter governs:



photon dissipation
structure suppression
collapse termination




linking cosmology to strong-field gravity.








S.11 Regime of Validity





This framework applies when



\lambda \gg l_b



where l_b is the bedrock anchoring scale.

Local quantum field behavior and nuclear physics remain unchanged.








S.12 Falsification Criteria





Scarlet is falsified if:



no post-merger echo modes exist
no phase lag is observed
ringdown spectra are fully Kerr
echo frequencies follow neither scaling law
no correlation exists with \alpha









S.13 Summary





Appendix S establishes that:



gravitational collapse halts mechanically
black holes possess finite interior depth
singularities are replaced by fracture surfaces
two mechanical regimes are allowed
ringdown encodes the material law of spacetime




Black holes are elastic defects in a finite medium.

Interpretive Note

The mechanical termination of collapse in Scarlet admits two internally consistent interpretations.

In the first, spacetime behaves as an elastic medium, such that increasing black hole mass produces a proportionally greater fracture depth. Collapse proceeds further as the applied gravitational load increases.

In the second, spacetime is treated as a finite material possessing an intrinsic failure thickness set by its microstructure. In this interpretation, collapse always terminates at the same physical depth, while increasing mass enlarges the lateral extent of the fracture surface rather than its depth.

Both interpretations satisfy the yield criterion and eliminate the formation of singularities.

In the present framework, the second interpretation is adopted: fracture depth is taken to be a material constant of the space fabric, while black hole mass determines the radius of the fracture surface. This choice reflects the underlying assumption of Scarlet that spacetime is a finite physical medium with a characteristic grain scale, rather than a purely elastic field without intrinsic thickness.

These two regimes lead to distinct predictions for post-merger torsional echo modes, particularly in their mass-scaling behavior. Future high-precision ringdown measurements may therefore distinguish between elastic and material-limited collapse.

The distinction between these interpretations has been a source of ongoing internal debate during the development of Scarlet. I encourage interested researchers to share alternative formulations or perspectives on this issue, as external insight may help clarify which mechanical description is ultimately favored by nature.
