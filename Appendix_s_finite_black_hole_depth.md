Appendix S: Finite-Depth Black Hole Interiors (Scarlet 2.0)





Mechanical Termination of Gravitational Collapse








S.1 Axiom: Finite Mechanical Extensibility





In Scarlet, spacetime is modeled as a nonlinear elastic medium with finite yield strength:



\sigma(r) = \sigma_y \approx 10^{113}\,\text{Pa}



When internal spacetime stress reaches this limit, further geometric compression is mechanically forbidden.

Gravitational collapse therefore terminates at a finite radius rather than forming a point singularity.








S.2 Constitutive Relation





The spacetime stress–strain relation is:



\sigma_{\mu\nu} = Y_{\mathrm{SF}} \, \varepsilon_{\mu\nu}



where:

• \sigma_{\mu\nu} is the spacetime stress tensor

• \varepsilon_{\mu\nu} is manifold strain

• Y_{\mathrm{SF}} is the space-fabric modulus



Failure occurs when |\varepsilon_{\mu\nu}| reaches the yield threshold corresponding to \sigma_y.








S.3 Fracture Radius





Define the Fracture Radius r_f by the condition:



\sigma(r_f) = \sigma_y



Two equivalent mechanical interpretations follow.








S.4 Regime I: Elastic Response (Load-Dependent Depth)





In the elastic response regime, the space fabric behaves as a stretchable medium.

The fracture depth scales with applied gravitational load:



r_f^{(I)} = R_s(1 - \alpha)



d_f^{(I)} = R_s - r_f^{(I)} = \alpha R_s



with:

R_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2}



Thus:



d_f^{(I)} = \alpha \frac{2GM}{c^2}



Fracture depth increases linearly with black hole mass.








S.5 Regime II: Material-Limited Response (Intrinsic Depth)





In the material-limited regime, the space fabric possesses an intrinsic failure thickness set by its microstructure:



d_f^{(II)} = d_0



independent of mass.



The fracture radius is then:



r_f^{(II)} = R_s - d_0



Increasing mass enlarges the fracture surface area rather than the depth.








S.6 Interior Structure





For both regimes, spacetime inside r_f enters a plastic-flow phase rather than divergent curvature.

Matter accumulates on a finite termination surface (“fracture floor”).



Properties:

• Finite interior volume

• No divergent curvature

• No infinite density

• No point singularity



The black hole interior behaves as a mechanically bounded cavity.








S.7 Torsional Echo Modes





The fracture floor acts as a resonant boundary.

Perturbations generate an elastic relaxation mode:



f_{\mathrm{echo}} \sim \frac{c}{d_f}



giving:



Elastic regime:

f_{\mathrm{echo}}^{(I)} \sim \frac{c}{\alpha R_s} \propto \frac{1}{M}



Material-limited regime:

f_{\mathrm{echo}}^{(II)} \sim \frac{c}{d_0} = \text{constant}








S.8 Phase Lag Signature





The torsional echo exhibits a phase offset due to fabric damping:



\phi = \alpha \pi



relative to the fundamental ringdown mode.

Vacuum Kerr harmonics are strictly in phase.

S.10 Relation to Appendix L





Appendix L defines the torsional damping constant:



\gamma = \alpha H_0



Appendix S defines fracture depth:



d_f^{(I)} = \alpha R_s



or



d_f^{(II)} = d_0



Thus the same torsional parameter governs:

• photon dissipation

• structure suppression

• collapse termination



linking cosmology to strong-field gravity.








S.11 Regime of Validity





This framework applies when:



\lambda \gg l_b



where l_b is the bedrock anchoring scale.

Local quantum field behavior and nuclear physics remain unchanged.








S.12 Falsification Criteria





Scarlet is falsified if:



No post-merger echo modes exist
No phase lag is observed
Ringdown spectra are fully Kerr
Echo frequencies fail to follow either scaling law
No correlation exists with \alpha









S.13 Summary





Appendix S establishes that:



• Gravitational collapse halts mechanically

• Black holes possess finite interior depth

• Singularities are replaced by fracture surfaces

• Two mechanical regimes are allowed

• Ringdown encodes the material law of spacetime



Black holes are elastic defects in a finite medium.

The mechanical termination of collapse in Scarlet may be viewed in two equivalent ways.



One interpretation treats spacetime as an elastic medium, in which increasing mass produces a proportionally deeper fracture. In this view, the mechanical depth scales with the Schwarzschild radius.



An equally consistent interpretation treats spacetime as a finite material with an intrinsic failure thickness. In this picture, collapse always terminates at the same physical depth set by the fabric’s microstructure, while increasing mass enlarges the fracture radius rather than the depth.



Both interpretations satisfy the yield criterion and prevent singularity formation.



In the present framework, I adopt the second view: that fracture depth is a material constant of the space fabric, while black hole mass determines the lateral extent of the fracture surface.

This reflects the underlying assumption of Scarlet that spacetime is a finite physical medium with a characteristic grain scale, rather than a purely elastic field without intrinsic thickness.



Observationally, these two regimes predict different scaling behavior for post-merger torsional echo modes, and future ringdown measurements may distinguish between them.



I would encourage interested researchers to share their own views on this point. This question has been a source of personal internal debate during the development of Scarlet, and a fresh perspective may help clarify which mechanical interpretation is ultimately favored by nature.
