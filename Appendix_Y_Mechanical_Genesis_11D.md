Appendix Y — Filament Lattice, Light, and the Pre-Geometric Bulk







Y.1  Pre-Bedrock Structure





Prior to the emergence of the 4D spacetime manifold, the universe existed as an 11-dimensional torsional bulk composed of filamentary degrees of freedom. This bulk is not a spatial extension in the conventional metric sense, but a topological reservoir of vibrational modes inaccessible to timelike observers.



The 11D bulk does not evolve under standard temporal flow. Instead, it acts as a mode-space in which geometric and energetic excitations are defined by torsional configuration rather than by distance or duration.



The emergence of the 4D manifold corresponds to a symmetry-reduction of this bulk into a dynamically coherent filament lattice.








Y.2  Filament Lattice Geometry





The spacetime fabric is modeled as a network of 1D filaments arranged in a higher-dimensional crystallographic packing. This lattice is not rigid but elastically stabilized by torsional root structures.



The stable configuration of this lattice admits a finite number of torsional microstates,

N_{\text{roots}} = 240,

corresponding to the number of mechanically permissible phase channels within the filament network.



This root structure governs:



allowable torsional wave modes,
energy transport limits,
and coherence stability.




The observed 4D universe arises as a projection of this lattice under dimensional compaction.








Y.3  Light as a Boundary Phenomenon





Photons do not propagate freely in the 11D bulk. In that regime, light has no timelike parameter and therefore does not experience propagation, redshift, or causal evolution.



Observable light emerges only when filament excitations intersect the 4D manifold, where:



torsional relaxation becomes radiative,
and phase structure becomes measurable as electromagnetic energy.




Thus, photons are not primary bulk objects, but surface excitations of the filament lattice as seen from within the 4D projection.



This explains why:



photons experience no proper time,
light appears invariant in speed,
and electromagnetic radiation is intrinsically geometric.









Y.4  Energy as Fabric Relaxation





Energy is not introduced externally into spacetime; it is a manifestation of filament relaxation within the lattice.



Mass corresponds to localized torsional stress.

Radiation corresponds to stress release into propagating modes.



From this perspective:



matter stores torsion,
light exports torsion,
and gravity redistributes torsion.




The energy budget of the universe is therefore regulated by lattice elasticity rather than by vacuum density.








Y.5  Mode Degeneracy and Packing Factor





The effective number of accessible torsional modes is determined by the ratio of higher-dimensional to lower-dimensional geometric degrees of freedom:

F = \frac{\Omega_{11}}{\Omega_4} \times N_{\text{torsion}} \approx 349.



This packing factor represents the torsional mode degeneracy of the filament lattice and governs:



the ultraviolet cutoff,
birefringence amplitude,
and coherence decay.




It replaces the infinite mode count of continuum field theory with a finite mechanical spectrum.








Y.6  Temporal Asymmetry Between Light and Matter





Matter evolves along the axial clock anchored at the VanAcker bedrock scale t_V.

Light does not.



This produces an apparent paradox:



matter experiences history,
photons experience boundary crossing.




This is resolved by recognizing that light exists in a phase-like regime beneath the spacetime surface and only acquires temporal identity upon projection into the 4D lattice.








Y.7  Observational Consequences





The filament lattice implies:



achromatic cosmic birefringence from global torsional twist,
bounded ultraviolet behavior from filament tensile limits,
parity-breaking signatures in photon transport,
and finite coherence in high-dimensional optical states.




These effects are not artifacts of fields in vacuum, but of mechanical response in a structured medium.








Y.8  Cross-Reference to Experimental Photonics





Recent experimental work on sculpted and topologically structured photon states demonstrates anomalous phase stability in high-dimensional optical modes.



Within the Scarlet–VanAcker framework, these systems are interpreted as laboratory analogs of torsional root stabilization in the filament lattice.



The observed resilience of sculpted photons corresponds to the predicted stability class

N_{\text{roots}} = 240,

which defines the number of mechanically admissible torsional phase channels.



The experimentally inferred coherence limits provide an empirical upper bound on torsional drag,

\delta_t \approx 0.083,

consistent with Scarlet’s prediction for shear-induced phase decoherence in high-dimensional states.



These results establish a direct bridge between cosmological torsion stability and engineered optical topologies.








Y.9  Interpretation





The 11D bulk is not “elsewhere.”

It is the latent phase space beneath spacetime.



Light is not a traveler through space.

It is the signature of space relaxing.



The universe is therefore not expanding into emptiness, but unfolding from a structured geometric reservoir whose properties determine the observable constants of nature.
