Appendix Q: Bedrock-Scale Gravity and Force Emergence (Scarlet 2.0)







Q.1 Foundational Scale (Bedrock Horizon)





Scarlet defines a fundamental temporal and geometric cutoff at

t_b \sim 10^{-41}\,\text{s}

corresponding to the smallest physically meaningful excitation of the spacetime fabric. This “Bedrock Horizon” replaces the Planck time as the operational lower bound of geometry.



Below this scale, spacetime is not continuous but exists in a pre-dynamic geometric phase incapable of supporting propagating modes.








Q.2 Pre-Bounce Geometric Phase (Crystalline Fabric)





Prior to t_b, the fabric existed in a high-symmetry, zero-entropy state termed the Geometric Crystalline Phase:



• No expansion

• No radiation

• No force mediation

• No causal structure



The Big Bang corresponds to a phase transition from this crystalline geometry into a torsion-capable elastic manifold. Time, curvature, and force propagation emerge only after this transition.








Q.3 Dimensional Interpretation





In Scarlet, gravity defines the first emergent dimension:



• The initial degree of freedom is radial fabric relaxation

• This manifests as scalar curvature (proto-gravity)

• Spatial dimensions unfold as secondary shear freedoms

• Time is identified with irreversible torsional relaxation



Thus dimensionality is not assumed but generated dynamically from fabric response.








Q.4 Force Differentiation from a Unified Fabric Mode





At t_b, all interactions arise from a single torsional stress mode:

Interaction

Emergence Mechanism

Gravity

Long-wavelength fabric curvature

Electromagnetism

Transverse torsional excitations

Strong force

Local torsional confinement

Weak force

Torsional chirality decay

Forces are not fundamental but represent scale-dependent expressions of torsional strain.








Q.5 Torsional Viscosity Coefficient (\eta)





In addition to the Fatigue Function \zeta, Scarlet introduces a torsional viscosity coefficient \eta, representing resistance of the fabric to rapid geometric reconfiguration.



This explains why:



• The universe does not “snap” at the Yield Point (~11.1 Gyr)

• Expansion enters a plastic flow regime

• Acceleration appears smooth rather than discontinuous





Prediction:



Gravitational waves passing through dense torsional choke points (e.g., massive attractors) should exhibit:

• slight phase lag

• mild dispersion

relative to pure GR predictions.








Q.6 Mechanical Time and Fabric Aging





Time is interpreted as cumulative torsional dissipation:

t_{\text{mech}} = \int \frac{d\theta}{\zeta(\rho)\,\eta}

The observed cosmic age (~13.8 Gyr) reflects a compressed clock due to increasing fatigue and viscosity.



Correcting for torsional damping yields a mechanical age of:

t_{\text{Scarlet}} \approx 14.3–14.6 \text{ Gyr}

representing the true duration of fabric evolution since the phase transition.








Q.7 Global Torsional Axis





The crystalline pre-phase defines a preferred torsional orientation that survives as a weak global axis in the current fabric.



This axis manifests as:

• birefringence bias

• large-angle CMB alignment

• weak parity violation in lensing



It is not imposed but inherited from the symmetry-breaking melt at t_b.








Q.8 Statistical Grain and Global Structure





Residual lattice structure from the crystalline phase produces a faint statistical grain in the cosmic background geometry.



This grain:

• affects only the largest angular modes

• is achromatic

• carries torsional phase information








Q.8.1 The Scarlet Scan Pattern (Achromatic Correlation Test)





To distinguish this grain from instrumental or astrophysical contamination, Scarlet predicts:



Frequency Independence
The alignment must persist across all Planck frequency channels (30–857 GHz).
A dust origin would vanish at high frequencies.
Torsional Grain Signature
A slow rotational twist should appear from \ell = 2 upward, forming a weak spiral dictated by the Fatigue Function \zeta.




Failure of either condition falsifies the torsional axis hypothesis.








Q.9 Regime of Validity





This framework applies only for:

\lambda \gg l_b

where l_b is the bedrock anchoring scale.



It preserves:

• local Lorentz invariance

• blackbody spectra

• standard nuclear physics

• quantum field behavior



while modifying only the global geometric response of spacetime.








Q.10 Summary





Appendix Q establishes that:



• Gravity is the first emergent fabric degree of freedom

• Forces arise from torsional differentiation

• Time is fabric aging

• The Big Bang is a phase transition

• A crystalline pre-phase imprints a weak global axis

• Observational tests exist



This unifies:

dimension, force, and time

under a single torsional mechanics.
