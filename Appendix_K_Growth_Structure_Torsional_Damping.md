### K.1 GROWTH OF COSMIC STRUCTURE (MECHANICAL DERIVATION)

Scarlet 2.0 modifies late-time structure formation through a torsional damping 
term acting on the growth of linear matter perturbations.

1. MODIFIED GROWTH EQUATION:
In the Scarlet framework, the growth factor D(a) is governed by:
D''(a) + [3/a + H'(a)/H(a) + Gamma(a)]D'(a) - 1.5[Omega(a)/a^2]D(a) = 0

2. TORSIONAL DAMPING TERM (Gamma):
The damping is triggered only after the spacetime fabric yield point:
Gamma(a) = [gamma_0 / (a * H(a))] * StepFunction(a - a_y)

3. CONSTANTS AND COEFFICIENTS:
- Slip Coefficient (gamma_0): 0.083
- Yield Epoch (t_y): 11.1 Billion Years
- Energy Limit: 125.125 GeV (Higgs Field Yield)

4. PHYSICAL PREDICTION:
This model predicts a constant 8.3% suppression in the growth rate (f*sigma8) 
for all redshifts below z < 0.21. 

This resolves the S8 tension as a mechanical friction effect of the 
space fabric rather than a geometric failure of General Relativity.
