### K.1 Growth of Cosmic Structure (Raw Derivation)

The following derivation is shielded from the builder to ensure deployment stability.

```text
Modified Growth Equation:
Standard: D''(a) + [3/a + H'(a)/H(a)]D'(a) - 1.5[Omega_m(a)/a^2]D(a) = 0

Scarlet: D''(a) + [3/a + H'(a)/H(a) + Gamma_zeta(a)]D'(a) - 1.5[G_eff/G][Omega_m(a)/a^2]D(a) = 0

Torsional Damping Term:
Gamma_zeta(a) = [gamma_0 / (a * H(a))] * Theta(a - a_y)

Constants:
gamma_0 = 0.083 (dimensionless slip of the space fabric)
t_y = 11.1 Gyr (yield epoch)
