Scarlet 2.0 modifies late-time structure formation through a torsional damping term acting on the growth of linear matter perturbations. This effect is negligible in the early universe (Appendix I) but becomes dynamically relevant once the spacetime fabric exits its linear elastic regime.

#### Modified Growth Equation

In standard $\Lambda$CDM, the linear growth factor $D(a)$ satisfies:

$$D''(a) + \left( \frac{3}{a} + \frac{H'(a)}{H(a)} \right) D'(a) - \frac{3}{2}\frac{\Omega_m(a)}{a^2} D(a) = 0$$

Scarlet introduces an additional damping term $\Gamma_\zeta(a)$ such that:

$$D''(a) + \left( \frac{3}{a} + \frac{H'(a)}{H(a)} + \Gamma_\zeta(a) \right) D'(a) - \frac{3}{2}\frac{G_{\text{eff}}(a)}{G}\frac{\Omega_m(a)}{a^2} D(a) = 0$$

The torsional term is parameterized as:

$$\Gamma_\zeta(a) = \frac{\gamma_0}{a H(a)} \cdot \Theta(a - a_y)$$

where $\gamma_0 \approx 0.083$ is a dimensionless slip coefficient and $a_y$ denotes the yield scale factor corresponding to a cosmic time $t_y \approx 11.1$ Gyr.

The Heaviside function $\Theta$ enforces the onset of damping only after the yield epoch. In this formulation, the modification enters as a friction-like term in the velocity of growth rather than as a modification of the gravitational coupling.
