K.1 Growth of Cosmic Structure





Scarlet 2.0 modifies late-time structure formation through a torsional damping term acting on the growth of linear matter perturbations. This effect is negligible in the early universe (Appendix I) but becomes dynamically relevant once the spacetime fabric exits its linear elastic regime.








Modified Growth Equation





In standard ΛCDM, the linear growth factor D(a) satisfies



D''(a) + \left( \frac{3}{a} + \frac{H'(a)}{H(a)} \right) D'(a) - \frac{3}{2}\frac{\Omega_m(a)}{a^2} D(a) = 0 .



Scarlet introduces an additional damping term \Gamma_\zeta(a) such that



D''(a) + \left( \frac{3}{a} + \frac{H'(a)}{H(a)} + \Gamma_\zeta(a) \right) D'(a) - \frac{3}{2}\frac{G_{\text{eff}}(a)}{G}\frac{\Omega_m(a)}{a^2} D(a) = 0 .



The torsional term is parameterized as



\Gamma_\zeta(a) = \frac{\gamma_0}{a H(a)} \, \Theta(a - a_y),



where

\gamma_0 \approx 0.083

is a dimensionless slip coefficient and a_y denotes the yield scale factor corresponding to a cosmic time t_y \approx 11.1 \,\text{Gyr}.

The Heaviside function \Theta enforces the onset of damping only after the yield epoch.



In this formulation, the modification enters as a friction-like term in the velocity of growth rather than as a modification of the gravitational coupling.








Prediction for f\sigma_8(z)





The growth rate is defined as



f(z) = \frac{d \ln D}{d \ln a}.



To leading order, Scarlet predicts



f\sigma_8^{\text{Scarlet}}(z) \approx (1 - \gamma_0)\, f\sigma_8^{\Lambda\text{CDM}}(z), \quad z < z_y ,



with



f\sigma_8^{\text{Scarlet}}(z) = f\sigma_8^{\Lambda\text{CDM}}(z), \quad z > z_y .



Thus the model predicts:



• suppression only at late times

• no modification at recombination

• a redshift-independent fractional damping

• no scale dependence in clustering








Comparison with Observations





Measurements from DESI, BOSS, and Euclid probe



0.1 < z < 1.5 .



Scarlet predicts:



• agreement with ΛCDM at z \gtrsim 1

• a systematic downward deviation at z \lesssim 0.8

• a constant fractional suppression amplitude



This reproduces the observed late-time suppression of structure growth without invoking modified gravity or time-dependent dark energy dynamics.








Falsification Criterion





Scarlet is falsified if



f\sigma_8(z) = f\sigma_8^{\Lambda\text{CDM}}(z)



to within observational uncertainties for all z < 1.



Conversely, confirmation of a constant fractional suppression would support the torsional damping hypothesis.








Physical Interpretation





The term



\frac{\gamma_0}{a H(a)}



acts as an effective viscous resistance on the growth of matter perturbations once the yield epoch is crossed.



By setting G_{\text{eff}} = G, the S_8 tension is isolated as a frictional effect rather than a modification of gravity itself:



• Gravity remains Einsteinian

• The clustering medium becomes resistive

• Suppression arises dynamically rather than geometrically
