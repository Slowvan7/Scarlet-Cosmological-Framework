Appendix F: Embedding the SCARLET Torsional Framework within ΛCDM



⸻

F.1 Purpose and Scope

This appendix demonstrates that the SCARLET torsional framework can be incorporated as a consistent extension of ΛCDM, rather than as a competing cosmological model. The central result is that SCARLET modifies perturbation dynamics and late-time structure growth while leaving the ΛCDM background expansion exactly intact.

⸻

F.2 ΛCDM Background Dynamics (Unmodified)

ΛCDM assumes a homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) spacetime with scale factor a(t). The background evolution is governed by

H^2 \equiv \left( \frac{\dot a}{a} \right)^2
= \frac{8\pi G}{3}\rho + \frac{\Lambda}{3},

\dot H = -4\pi G (\rho + p).

SCARLET assumption.
The torsional sector does not modify these background field equations. All torsional effects enter only at the perturbative and mesoscopic levels.

This construction ensures:
	•	preservation of CMB acoustic peak positions,
	•	preservation of the BAO scale,
	•	retention of early-universe ΛCDM successes.

F.3 Standard ΛCDM Growth of Matter Perturbations

For sub-horizon scalar perturbations, ΛCDM predicts the evolution of the matter density contrast \delta \equiv \delta\rho/\rho according to

\ddot{\delta} + 2H\dot{\delta}
- 4\pi G \rho \, \delta = 0.

This equation assumes:
	•	pressureless matter,
	•	absence of intrinsic spacetime dissipation,
	•	no geometric memory or torsion.

⸻

F.4 SCARLET Modification: Effective Torsional Damping

SCARLET introduces an effective torsional fatigue field \zeta, representing a geometric resistance of spacetime to coherent deformation.

The growth equation is modified to

\ddot{\delta}
+ \left( 2H + \Gamma_\zeta \right)\dot{\delta}
- 4\pi G_{\mathrm{eff}} \rho \, \delta = 0,

where the torsional damping rate is defined as

\Gamma_\zeta \equiv \alpha \, \zeta \, H.

Here:
	•	\zeta is a dimensionless torsional fatigue parameter,
	•	\alpha is a coupling constant setting the late-time strength,
	•	G_{\mathrm{eff}} \to G in the weak-torsion limit.

Key property
\lim_{\zeta \to 0} \Gamma_\zeta = 0
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
\text{ΛCDM recovered exactly.}

F.5 Implications for the S_8 Tension

The observable parameter

S_8 \equiv \sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_m / 0.3}

is sensitive to the integrated growth history of \delta.
	•	ΛCDM predicts comparatively strong late-time growth,
	•	SCARLET suppresses growth through the damping term \Gamma_\zeta,
	•	no modification of early-time normalization is required.

At late times, the growth may be approximated as

\delta(a) \sim a^{\,1 - \epsilon(\zeta)},
\qquad
\epsilon(\zeta) \sim \mathcal{O}(0.05\text{–}0.1),

yielding a level of suppression consistent with that inferred from low-redshift weak-lensing surveys such as KiDS-1000 and DESI.

F.6 Relation to General Relativity with Torsion

SCARLET is mathematically compatible with Einstein–Cartan theory, in which spacetime torsion T^\lambda_{\;\mu\nu} supplements curvature.

A schematic effective action may be written as

S = \int d^4x \sqrt{-g}
\left[
\frac{1}{16\pi G} R
+ \zeta \, \mathcal{T}^2
+ \mathcal{L}_m
\right],

where:
	•	R is the Ricci scalar,
	•	\mathcal{T}^2 is a quadratic torsion invariant,
	•	\zeta controls torsional stiffness.

In the cosmological background limit,

\mathcal{T}^2 \to 0
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
\text{standard GR is recovered}.

⸻

F.7 Post-Newtonian Consistency

SCARLET predicts small corrections to the parametrized post-Newtonian parameter \gamma,

\gamma = 1 - \epsilon_\zeta,
\qquad
\epsilon_\zeta \ll 10^{-5},

satisfying constraints from:
	•	solar-system tests,
	•	binary pulsar timing,
	•	gravitational lensing observations.

⸻

F.8 Interpretation
	•	ΛCDM governs what expands,
	•	SCARLET governs how structure resists collapse,
	•	ΛCDM provides kinematics,
	•	SCARLET provides effective mechanics.

SCARLET thus functions as a viscoelastic completion of ΛCDM, introducing spacetime memory while preserving early-universe physics.

F.9 Synthesis and Implications

The analysis in Appendix F has treated SCARLET strictly as a constrained extension of the ΛCDM framework, preserving its empirical successes while introducing additional structure at sub-background order. By construction, SCARLET leaves the homogeneous expansion history unchanged and remains consistent with primary early-universe observables, including CMB and BAO measurements at leading order.

Within this restricted regime, SCARLET introduces effective torsion-like contributions that do not propagate as independent degrees of freedom and that vanish smoothly in the general-relativistic limit. These contributions become relevant only in specific dynamical or environmental contexts, allowing departures from ΛCDM to remain suppressed where observational bounds are strongest, while offering mechanisms to address known late-time phenomenological tensions.

In particular, the framework permits a controlled suppression of late-time structure growth, potentially alleviating aspects of the S_8 discrepancy without modifying early-time physics. The same structural features also provide a basis for mesoscopic coherence effects that lie outside the explanatory scope of vanilla ΛCDM.

These results should be interpreted as qualitative and conditional, not as definitive resolutions. The role of SCARLET at this stage is not to replace ΛCDM, but to demonstrate that a minimal, internally consistent extension can address multiple outstanding issues simultaneously while respecting existing observational constraints.

This synthesis motivates the concluding discussion, where the broader implications, limitations, and testable predictions of the ΛCDM + SCARLET framework are assessed.
