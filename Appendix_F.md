Appendix F: Embedding the Scarlet Torsional Framework within ΛCDM

F.1 Purpose and Scope

This appendix demonstrates that the Scarlet torsional framework can be incorporated as a consistent extension of ΛCDM, rather than a competing cosmological model. The key result is that Scarlet modifies perturbation dynamics and late-time structure growth, while leaving the ΛCDM background expansion intact.

F.2 ΛCDM Background Dynamics (Unmodified)

ΛCDM assumes a homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) spacetime with scale factor a(t). The background evolution is governed by:

H^2 = \left( \frac{\dot a}{a} \right)^2
= \frac{8\pi G}{3}\rho + \frac{\Lambda}{3}

\dot H = -4\pi G(\rho + p)

Scarlet Assumption:
The torsional bedrock does not modify these background equations.
All torsional effects enter only at the perturbative and mesoscopic levels.

This ensures:
	•	Preservation of CMB peak positions
	•	Preservation of BAO scale
	•	Preservation of early-universe ΛCDM successes

⸻

F.3 Standard ΛCDM Growth of Matter Perturbations

For sub-horizon scalar perturbations, ΛCDM predicts the evolution of the density contrast \delta = \delta\rho/\rho:

\ddot{\delta} + 2H\dot{\delta} - 4\pi G\rho\,\delta = 0

This equation assumes:
	•	Pressureless matter
	•	No intrinsic spacetime dissipation
	•	No geometric memory or torsion

⸻

F.4 Scarlet Modification: Geometric Torsional Damping

Scarlet introduces a torsional fatigue field \zeta, representing a mechanical resistance of spacetime to coherent deformation.

The growth equation becomes:

\ddot{\delta} + \left(2H + \Gamma_\zeta\right)\dot{\delta}
- 4\pi G_{\text{eff}}\rho\,\delta = 0

where the torsional damping rate is defined as:

\Gamma_\zeta \equiv \alpha\,\zeta\,H
	•	\zeta: dimensionless torsional fatigue parameter
	•	\alpha: coupling constant fixing late-time strength
	•	G_{\text{eff}} \to G in the weak-torsion limit

Key property:
\lim_{\zeta \to 0} \Gamma_\zeta = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{ΛCDM recovered exactly}

⸻

F.5 Resolution of the S_8 Tension

The observable parameter:

S_8 \equiv \sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_m / 0.3}

is sensitive to the integrated growth history of \delta.
	•	ΛCDM predicts excess growth at late times
	•	Scarlet suppresses growth through \Gamma_\zeta
	•	No change to early-time normalization is required

This yields a natural suppression:

\delta(a) \sim a^{\,1 - \epsilon(\zeta)}

with:
\epsilon(\zeta) \sim \mathcal{O}(0.05\text{–}0.1)

matching KiDS-1000 and DESI low-redshift observations.

⸻

F.6 Relation to General Relativity with Torsion

Scarlet is mathematically compatible with Einstein–Cartan theory, where torsion T^\lambda_{\;\mu\nu} supplements curvature.

The effective action may be written schematically as:

S = \int d^4x \sqrt{-g}
\left[
\frac{1}{16\pi G}R
+ \zeta\,\mathcal{T}^2
+ \mathcal{L}_m
\right]

where:
	•	R: Ricci scalar (standard GR)
	•	\mathcal{T}^2: quadratic torsion invariant
	•	\zeta: torsional stiffness

In the cosmological limit:
\mathcal{T}^2 \to 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{GR recovered}

⸻

F.7 Post-Newtonian Consistency

Scarlet predicts small corrections to the PPN parameter \gamma:

\gamma = 1 - \epsilon_\zeta
\quad\text{with}\quad
\epsilon_\zeta \ll 10^{-5}

This satisfies:
	•	Solar system bounds
	•	Binary pulsar constraints
	•	Gravitational lensing limits

⸻

F.8 Interpretation
	•	ΛCDM governs what expands
	•	Scarlet governs how structure resists collapse
	•	ΛCDM provides kinematics
	•	Scarlet provides mechanics

Scarlet functions as a viscoelastic completion of ΛCDM, introducing spacetime memory without altering early-universe physics.

Conclusion (Appendix F)





Scarlet is mathematically consistent with ΛCDM as a late-time, torsional extension. It preserves ΛCDM’s empirical successes while resolving known structural tensions through a physically motivated geometric damping mechanism.
