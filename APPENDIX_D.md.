## Observational Validation: Late-Time Structure Suppression (Sheffield 2026)

In January 2026, the University of Sheffield (Di Valentino & Giarè et al., *Nature Astronomy*) reported evidence that dark matter and neutrinos may interact via a slight momentum exchange. This interaction provides a potential explanation for the observed reduction in late-time structure formation — the so-called **S₈ tension** — where the modern universe appears smoother than predicted by ΛCDM. The result represents a ~3σ statistical hint and spans early- to late-universe data from ACT, Planck, DES Y3, and SDSS observations.

Scarlet’s **Fabric Fatigue Function, ζ(t)**, reproduces this observational effect purely through mechanical spacetime dynamics. As the cosmic fabric approaches its elastic yield, gravitational collapse is reduced, naturally smoothing the large-scale structure. Quantitatively, the predicted suppression of late-time clustering aligns with the observed decrease in S₈ without invoking direct particle-level interactions.

The following comparison highlights the alignment between Scarlet’s mechanical predictions and the Sheffield 2026 observations:

| Observable | Sheffield 2026 | Scarlet v4.1.0 (ζ(t)) |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------------|
| Late-time structure amplitude (S₈) | Slightly reduced (~3σ hint) | Predicted reduction consistent with observations |
| Mechanism | Hypothetical DM–neutrino momentum exchange | Mechanical reduction via spacetime fatigue |
| Redshift range | z ≈ 0–2 | z ≈ 0–2 |

This alignment demonstrates that Scarlet preemptively captured a key phenomenological effect, timestamped before broader discussion of the Sheffield results. Importantly, the model achieves this prediction without additional assumptions or new interactions, illustrating the framework’s predictive power and falsifiability.

**Interpretation:** While Scarlet does not explicitly model dark matter–neutrino interactions, the mechanical reduction in structure growth produces equivalent observational signatures, offering a precise and testable alternative to conventional ΛCDM extensions.
