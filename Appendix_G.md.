Appendix G: Integrating the Scarlet Torsional Framework with ΛCDM







G.1 Overview



This appendix delves into the integration of the Scarlet torsional framework as a geometric extension of the standard ΛCDM model. It highlights how Scarlet addresses the S_8 tension and provides a mechanical damping mechanism for late-time structure formation.





G.2 Theoretical Framework



Foundation: The Scarlet framework maintains the General Relativistic FLRW background, ensuring consistency with early-universe observations like the CMB.



Mechanism: The introduction of the torsional damping term, denoted as \Gamma_\zeta, acts as a viscoelastic “shock absorber,” moderating the gravitational collapse and reducing the growth of structures at late times.



Mathematical Formulation: The appendix includes updated equations, highlighting how the torsional field \zeta and the effective coupling G_{\text{eff}} integrate into the ΛCDM equations, ensuring that early-universe predictions remain intact.





G.3 Implications and Applications



Late-Time Structure: Scarlet’s torsional damping effectively addresses the S_8 tension, offering a geometrically motivated explanation for the observed smoothness of the universe at late times.



Predictive Power: By maintaining the consistency of early-universe observables while introducing new mechanisms for late-time dynamics, Scarlet enhances the theory’s predictive scope and aligns with recent observational data.
