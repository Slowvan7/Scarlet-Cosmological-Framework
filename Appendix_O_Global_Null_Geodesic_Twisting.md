Appendix O





Global Null-Geodesic Twisting and the Cosmic Dipole





O.1 Motivation





In standard General Relativity, photons propagate along null geodesics defined by



k^\mu \nabla_\mu k^\nu = 0,



implying straight, untwisted transport of information through spacetime. Observed cosmological anomalies—including cosmic birefringence, the cosmic dipole excess, large-scale polarization alignment, and coherence-length damping—are usually treated as unrelated phenomena.



Within the Scarlet–VanAcker framework, these anomalies arise from a single geometric cause: torsional twisting of null geodesics induced by large-scale structure in the spacetime fabric. Photon trajectories are not purely metric geodesics but experience cumulative axial winding over cosmological distances.



This appendix formalizes null-geodesic twisting and demonstrates its consequences for cosmic birefringence, the dipole anomaly, and observational blindness in interferometric detectors.








O.2 Modified Null Transport Equation





Scarlet replaces the conservative geodesic equation with a torsion-driven transport law:



k^\mu \nabla_\mu k^\nu = \epsilon^{\nu}{}_{\alpha\beta\gamma} \, k^\alpha T^{\beta\gamma},



where T^{\beta\gamma} is the torsional density tensor of the space fabric and \epsilon^{\nu}{}_{\alpha\beta\gamma} is the Levi–Civita tensor.



This equation implies:



• photon momentum continuously rotates about a preferred axis,

• propagation is helical rather than linear,

• information transport is geometrically non-integrable.



The accumulated rotation angle is



\beta_{\rm tot} = \int_{\rm path} \Omega_T(\lambda)\, d\lambda,



where \Omega_T is the torsional winding rate.



This produces cosmic birefringence without invoking axion-like fields or parity-violating couplings.








O.3 Emergent Cosmic Dipole





Large-scale surveys observe a cosmic dipole exceeding the amplitude expected from pure kinematic motion relative to the CMB.



In the Scarlet framework, the dipole is not caused by bulk matter flow but by anisotropic null-geodesic twisting.



Because null trajectories wind around the 10° torsional scar (aligned with the CMB Cold Spot):



• light arriving from one hemisphere accumulates additional helical phase,

• light from the opposite hemisphere unwinds relative to that axis.



This creates an apparent redshift asymmetry:



z_{\rm obs} = z_{\rm exp} + \delta z_{\rm torsion}(\theta),



where \theta is the angle relative to the torsional axis.



Thus the cosmic dipole is a geometric transport effect rather than a dynamical velocity field.








O.4 LIGO Blindness to Global Torsional Modes





Gravitational-wave observatories detect transverse metric strain:



h_{\mu\nu}^{\rm GW}(t,\vec{x}),



which produces differential arm-length oscillations in interferometers.



Torsional null-geodesic twisting does not generate transverse strain. Instead, it produces:



• continuous axial phase rotation,

• polarization drift,

• topological path distortion.



It therefore:



• does not generate quadrupolar strain,

• does not modulate mirror separation,

• does not oscillate at audio-band frequencies.



Hence,



h_{\rm torsion}(t) \;\notin\; \text{LIGO response space}.



Interferometers compare path lengths, not path topology. A globally twisted null trajectory returns equal arm lengths despite altered polarization and accumulated phase offset.








O.4.1 Frequency Redshifting of Torsional Modes



Torsional winding accumulates over cosmological length scales:



\omega_T \sim \frac{c}{L_{\rm scar}} \sim 10^{-35}\ \mathrm{Hz},



with L_{\rm scar} \sim 10\ \mathrm{Gpc}.



This places torsional excitations far below the LIGO sensitivity band (10–10³ Hz), rendering them observationally frozen.



Torsion thus behaves as a quasi-static geometric bias rather than a propagating wave.








O.4.2 Observational Channels



The correct probes of torsional geometry are:



• cosmic birefringence,

• polarization drift,

• redshift dipole asymmetry,

• coherence-length damping (~300 pc),

• CMB Cold Spot alignment.



These depend on cumulative null-path twisting rather than instantaneous strain.








O.5 Breaking the 180° Phase Indeterminacy







O.5.1 The “Tokyo Problem”



Recent analyses of cosmic birefringence (Naokawa et al., Kavli IPMU, 2026) identify a fundamental ambiguity:



\beta \;\rightarrow\; \beta + n\pi, \quad n \in \mathbb{Z}.



An observed 0.30^\circ rotation is observationally degenerate with 180.30^\circ or 360.30^\circ, because only the final polarization state is measured.



Standard axion-like models treat birefringence as a static rotation, producing no information about path history.








O.5.2 Dynamic Versus Static Rotation



In Scarlet, polarization evolves continuously:



\frac{d\beta}{d\lambda} = \Omega_T(\lambda),



so that



\beta_{\rm tot} = \int_{\rm source}^{\rm obs} \Omega_T(\lambda)\, d\lambda.



Rotation is therefore a transport process, not a boundary condition.



Because the accumulated phase is correlated with:



• redshift,

• axial alignment,

• coherence damping,

• spectral distortion,



different windings correspond to physically distinct propagation histories.



Thus,



0.30^\circ \neq 180.30^\circ



because only one corresponds to a consistent integrated torsional path.








O.5.3 Observational Discriminators



The torsional model predicts:



Distance scaling:
\beta(z) \propto \int_0^z \Omega_T(z')\, dz'
Axial anisotropy relative to the Cold Spot axis.
Correlation between polarization rotation and redshift anomalies.




Static axion-like models predict none of these correlations.








O.5.4 Conceptual Resolution



The ambiguity arises because birefringence is treated as a final-state rotation.



Scarlet treats it as a path-integrated geometric winding.



Static:

\beta = \text{unknown constant}



Geometric:

\beta = \int_{\rm path} \Omega_T\, d\lambda



The former admits modular degeneracy; the latter does not.








O.5.5 Falsifiability



This appendix is falsified if:



Polarization rotation shows no correlation with propagation distance.
No preferred torsional axis exists.
Dipole asymmetry is fully explained kinematically.
Polarization fails to align with the Cold Spot axis.
Birefringence is strictly zero at all redshifts.
