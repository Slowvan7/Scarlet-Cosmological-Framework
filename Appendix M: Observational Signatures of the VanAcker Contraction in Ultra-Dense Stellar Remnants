White Dwarf Signatures of the VanAcker Contraction








M.1 Context and Motivation





Scarlet 2.0 introduces a torsional damping constant

α₀ ≈ 0.083,

which is proposed to modify gravitational and thermodynamic behavior in ultra-dense stellar objects.



White dwarfs provide a natural testbed for this hypothesis because of their extreme densities and well-characterized observables. Recent spectroscopic surveys (e.g., SDSS-V) report systematic radial-velocity offsets in the range 5–15 km s⁻¹, typically attributed to wavelength-calibration systematics or line-formation effects rather than new physics.



Scarlet instead interprets these anomalies as potential signatures of a density-dependent contraction of the space fabric (hereafter, the VanAcker Contraction).








M.2 Velocity Shift Hypothesis





Scarlet predicts that the effective gravitational redshift is modified by the torsional suppression constant according to



v_Scarlet = v_GR (1 − α₀)⁻¹



For a representative ultra-massive white dwarf with

M ≈ 1.2 M☉,

the standard GR gravitational redshift is approximately



v_GR ≈ 126 km s⁻¹.



Applying the Scarlet correction yields



v_Scarlet ≈ 137.5 km s⁻¹,



corresponding to an excess shift



Δv ≈ 11.5 km s⁻¹.



This offset lies within current observational uncertainties but is systematic and therefore testable with sufficiently large samples and improved calibration.








M.3 Cooling Delays (Q-Branch)







Standard Interpretation





The observed “Q-branch” overdensity in the white dwarf luminosity function is commonly attributed to chemical energy release, particularly Neon-22 sedimentation, which slows cooling by releasing latent heat.





Scarlet Interpretation





Scarlet proposes that the VanAcker Contraction stores gravitational energy in the space fabric as torsional strain. As the star cools and contracts, this stored energy is gradually released into the stellar interior.



The available energy scale is estimated as



E_torsion ≈ 7.8 × 10⁴² J,



sufficient to delay cooling by approximately



Δt ≈ 8 Gyr.





Clarification (Baryonic-Leak Counter-Argument)





This energy is not radiated impulsively. It is stored non-radiatively in the space fabric and couples to baryonic matter only as the stellar density approaches the VanAcker saturation threshold during crystallization. This prevents anomalous luminosity spikes and avoids conflict with observed cooling curves.








M.4 Falsifiability and Testing







M.4.4 VanAcker Invariant





A discriminant is required to separate genuine contraction from simple mass misestimation.



Under standard GR, spectroscopic surface gravity (log g) and gravitational redshift (z_g) are tightly coupled. Scarlet predicts that in ultra-dense stars, torsional contraction increases z_g beyond that implied by log g:



z_{g,Scarlet} ≈ z_{g,GR} (1 + α₀).



A systematic ≈ 8.3 % excess in z_g relative to log g therefore indicates engagement of the space fabric rather than excess mass.








M.5 Terminology and Thresholds







M.5.1 Bedrock Saturation Threshold





The VanAcker Contraction becomes significant only when the stellar density approaches



ρ_crit ≈ 10⁶ g cm⁻³.



This explains both

• the presence of the effect in high-mass white dwarfs, and

• its absence in low-density main-sequence stars.








M.5.2 Naming Conventions





The generic term “torsional contraction” is replaced by:



• VanAcker Contraction

• Bedrock Limit



to associate the effect directly with the Scarlet formalism.








M.5.3 Null Test (Solar-Type Stars)





Main-sequence stars do not approach ρ_crit.



Therefore, α₀ corrections must be observationally negligible in such systems. This distinguishes Scarlet from tired-light or generic modified-redshift models.








M.6 Summary of Predictions





Velocity Verification
High-mass white dwarfs should exhibit
Δv ≈ α₀ v_GR ≈ 11.5 km s⁻¹.
Cooling Delay
The Q-branch stagnation arises from gradual release of torsional strain energy.
Spectroscopic Signature
A decoupling of log g and z_g at the ≈ 8 % level.
Density Threshold
No detectable effect below
ρ_crit ≈ 10⁶ g cm⁻³.
